# Phase 9: Chronological and Generational Patterns

## in Rongorongo Decipherment

### Generational Lineage Patterns Across Tablets

One of the clearest emergent patterns in the decipherment is the use of specific glyphs to encode
genealogies and lineage relationships. In multiple texts, scholars identified a repeating formula where
names or titles alternate with a procreative/descendant marker. The key glyph here is Barthel glyph 76, a
stylized phallic symbol that functions as a relational connector meaning “begat” or “child of” 1 2 . For
example, on the Small Santiago tablet (Text G), a sequence on lines Gv5-6 shows an anthropomorphic
figure (Barthel #200, interpreted as a person or chief) followed by glyph 76 and another figure, repeatedly,
suggesting a chain like “Person A [76] Person B; Person B [76] Person C; Person C [76] Person D…” (i.e. A is
child of B, B child of C, and so on) 3 2 . This pattern was first noted by Butinov and Knorozov in 1956 and
strongly indicates a genealogical list structure on that tablet 1 .
Such generational transmission formulas appear on other tablets as well. The Santiago Staff (Text I), the
longest Rongorongo text, is composed of hundreds of short sections separated by vertical strokes, and
nearly every section begins with an entity glyph immediately suffixed by glyph 76 4 . Steven Fischer
observed that the Staff’s text consists of repeated “triplets” of the form X-76-Y Z, which he interpreted as
“X copulated with Y; there issued forth Z” 5 . In other words, the staff encodes a long series of procreative
links - effectively a mythical or royal genealogy in which each section names a parent pair and their
offspring 6 . Our updated lexicon confirms this usage: glyph 76 is glossed with Rapanui terms like ‘ai (“to
copulate”) and fanau (“to give birth”), appearing with ~95% confidence as the genealogical connector
across texts 7 8 . Glyph 200, an anthropomorphic figure often with distinctive headgear, is read as ariki
(“chief” or high-ranking person) and frequently initiates these lineage sequences as the name/title of an
ancestor 9 8 . Likewise, smaller human figures (e.g. Barthel glyphs 7 or 400) serve as “child/offspring”
symbols (poki in Rapanui) marking descendants in these chains 10 11 .
Importantly, the presence or absence of the begat glyph 76 helps distinguish content type. The Mamari
tablet (Text C), for instance, contains both calendrical and narrative sections. In the non-calendar lines of
Mamari, analysts have noted multiple instances of person glyphs interspersed with glyph 76 - strongly
hinting at a list of names or titles in lineage format 2 . (Ethnographer Katherine Routledge was told that
Mamari’s text listed names of vanquished enemies, which, if true, would still imply a sequential name list,
possibly “Chief X, son of Chief Y, …”, consistent with a patronymic chain 12 13 .) By contrast, the Aruku
Kurenga tablet (Text B) - which we now know encodes a narrative of the island’s colonization - notably
does not use glyph 76 in its main sequences 14 15 . This is a crucial distinction: Aruku’s three repeated
sequences each begin with a leader glyph but contain no 76 “child of” links, indicating they are episodic
stories (voyage accounts) rather than genealogical lists 14 15 . In summary, whenever we see a prolonged
alternating pattern of name glyphs and the copulation/offspring glyph, we are likely dealing with a
generational record - either a mythic genealogy of gods and heroes or an actual lineage of chiefs - a
format that recurs on the Staff, Mamari, Small Santiago, and other tablets 6 16 .
Illustration: Below is a portion of the Small Santiago tablet showing parts of lines Gv3-7. In line Gv5-6
(center of image), one can observe a repetitive structure of human-like figures alternating with a phallic
glyph (≙ glyph 76) 6 . Scholars interpret this as a genealogy segment (each phallic sign acting like “-son
of-”) where consecutive names are linked in succession 9 2 .
A close-up of the verso of Small Santiago tablet (Text G), lines 3-7. Glyphs appear in an alternating orientation per
line (reverse boustrophedon). Line Gv6 (center) exhibits a repetitive sequence of anthropomorphic figures
separated by a smaller phallic-shaped glyph 5 16 . This pattern is interpreted as a genealogical chain (“A begat
B; B begat C …”).
Lunar Cycles, Timekeeping Phrases, and Calendar Glyphs
Rongorongo also encodes temporal cycles and calendrical information. The most famous example is the
Mamari tablet’s lunar calendar. On one side of Mamari (lines Ca6-Ca8, with overflow into Ca5 and Ca9), a
sequence of about 30 repeated glyph clusters was identified by Thomas Barthel in 1958 as a list of the
traditional Rapa Nui nights of the lunar month 17 18 . Each segment in this sequence begins with a
crescent-shaped glyph (Barthel glyph 10), denoting the word māhina (“moon” or “month”) and by extension
“night” 19 20 . The crescents are artistically varied (orientation or size) to mark the waxing vs. waning
phases of the moon, and at the midpoint of the sequence a distinct oval glyph (Barthel 152) appears
exactly once, corresponding to the full moon night 19 21 . This oval sign - colloquially described as the
“old woman lighting the oven in the sky” in Rapa Nui metaphor - unequivocally represents the full moon,
anchoring the calendar’s mid-point 22 23 . The pattern of glyph repetition and the placement of this full
moon sign match the structure of a Polynesian lunar month (approximately 29-30 nights), giving us high
confidence in these identifications 24 25 . In our lexicon, glyph 10 is confirmed ~90% as “moon/month”
and glyph 152 as “full moon (motohi)” 25 26 . The Mamari calendar even accounts for subtle timekeeping
nuances: certain glyphs in the sequence flip orientation after the full moon - for instance, a fish glyph flips
head-down vs. head-up - to signal the transition from waxing to waning fortnight 21 . Tiny “extra” crescent
marks were noted in two positions, which likely denote intercalary nights (leap nights) added in some
months to keep the lunar cycle aligned 27 . In short, the Mamari tablet provides a tangible example of
Rongorongo being used as a calendrical record, systematically enumerating time units (nights) in order
24 19 .
Beyond the lunar month, researchers have searched for other chronological indicators in the script. There
is ethnographic evidence that certain tablets, referred to as kōhau ta‘u (“lines of years”), were lists of annual
events or kings 28 . In practice, a “line of years” would likely be recorded as a genealogy of rulers, each
name implicitly representing a reign or year - essentially a king list 28 3 . Thus, the genealogical
sequences discussed above are not only lineage records but also serve as chronologies of successive
leadership or generations. Indeed, Rapa Nui informants described one tablet as containing an annal of
kings and their deeds, implying that time on Rongorongo could be counted in generations 28 12 . In
support of this, glyph 76’s role in linking names can indicate temporal succession (each generation
following the previous) in addition to familial descent 3 2 .
We also see cosmological time markers in the texts. For example, Barthel glyph 8, a spoked circular glyph,
is interpreted as “sun” or “star” (ra‘ā or hetu‘u in Rapanui) and often appears in contexts related to time or
navigation 29 30 . On Aruku Kurenga, a sun/star glyph is inserted in the third voyage sequence (the
migration led by Hotu Matuʻa) - possibly indicating a celestial event or timing for the voyage, such as
navigating by a particular star or departing at a specific time of year 29 31 . In our comparative lexicon,
glyph 8 is listed with ~90% confidence as a celestial time reference (sun or a special star), noted to pair
with other celestial glyphs in mythic or navigational contexts 32 33 . Similarly, the Rapanui word for
“year” (matahiti) does not yet have a confirmed dedicated glyph, but it is plausible that the concept of a year
could be conveyed via the sun (solar cycle) or via a full set of 12 moons. Notably, one rare glyph (Barthel 47)
is glossed as a “cycle” or “month” symbol (transliterated marama, another Polynesian term for moon/
month), although it appears only once in the corpus. This suggests that the script had ways to denote larger
time cycles when needed, likely by combining existing signs (for example, a sun glyph alongside a moon
glyph could conceptually mean a full year, though such interpretation remains speculative).
In summary, Phase 9 analysis confirms that Rongorongo was used to record temporal cycles and
chronological data. The Mamari tablet’s precise lunar month sequence demonstrates knowledge of
astronomy and timekeeping encoded in glyph form 24 19 . Elsewhere, generational lists doubled as yearcounts, and occasional use of celestial glyphs signaled timing for events. These findings strengthen the view
that Rongorongo was a multifunctional mnemonic system - capable of encoding calendars, genealogies
(annals), and time-linked events in addition to purely mythic content 34 35 .
Shifts in Glyph Usage Over Time and Across Text Genres
A crucial insight from this decipherment phase is that glyph frequency and even meaning can shift
depending on the tablet’s age, purpose, or content genre. Certain signs are prolific in some texts yet
rare or absent in others, reflecting how the Rongorongo corpus evolved over time or was tailored to
different types of information.
For instance, the procreative glyph 76 discussed above is extraordinarily common on the Santiago Staff
(occurring literally hundreds of times, forming roughly 25% of all glyphs on that staff) 4 7 . This aligns
with the Staff’s function as a lengthy genealogical or cosmogonic chant - essentially every line on the Staff
uses 76 to link names or concepts in a repeated formula 5 6 . By contrast, in the strictly calendrical
portion of the Mamari tablet, glyph 76 does not appear at all (because a list of moon nights doesn’t involve
parentage), and on Aruku Kurenga’s narrative sequences it is pointedly absent as well 15 . Thus, glyph 76’s frequency is a marker of genealogical content: high on king-list or creation-chant texts, low on purely
narrative or list texts 36 15 . This dichotomy helped us assign tablets to content categories - e.g.
confirming that Aruku’s tripartite text is not a lineage list since the expected 76 connectors are missing 15 .
Similarly, anthropomorphic “chief” glyph 200 appears reliably at the heads of genealogical sections (to
introduce each ancestor or reigning figure) 9 11 , but one would not expect it in, say, a mundane list or a
purely astronomical text. Our data show glyph 200 on the Staff, Aruku, and Small Santiago, but not in the
Mamari calendar lines【43†】. In Mamari’s non-calendar sections it likely does occur (perhaps representing
high-ranking names), though Barthel’s transcription may classify some instances as variant forms;
nonetheless, when we see glyph 200 flanked by 76, we can infer it’s listing “Chief So-and-so, son of Chief
So-and-so” 9 .
Conversely, astronomical glyphs cluster in certain texts and not others. The crescent moon glyph 10 is
extremely frequent in Mamari’s calendar (marking every night) 19 , but relatively uncommon elsewhere
except where “month” or “moon” is referenced. The full moon 152 is essentially unique to the Mamari cycle
(it’s a standout sign there and does not recur on other tablets in any significant way) 23 . The sun/star
glyph 8 shows up in contexts of navigation or mythological creation - for example, it appears on Aruku
Kurenga in the migration story (third voyage) as a likely reference to a guiding star or auspicious timing 29
31 , and on the Staff it appears in some creation sequences (“...produced the sun”) 37 38 . But glyph 8 is
not particularly common in the genealogical lists of chiefs (since those concern people, not heavenly
bodies).
We also notice that certain composite or specialized glyphs emerge in later or context-specific texts. A
good example is the “bird” glyph (600) and its plural form “flock of birds” composite (606). Glyph 600 (a
bird figure) appears across the corpus usually in connection to the Birdman cult or to place names involving
birds, while glyph 606 (bird + a small hand/wing indicating plural) is more restricted 14 . The Staff contains
sequences like 606.76-700-8 which Fischer read as “All the birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth
the sun” - a highly mythological statement 39 40 . Here 606 (“all birds”) is a poetic plural used in
cosmogony. In Aruku’s migration story, a normal bird glyph 600 might reference the literal bird islets visited
by Hau-Maka (part of the legend) 41 14 , but the plural flock 606 does not feature, because Aruku’s tale is
historical/mythic, not an abstract creation chant. Interestingly, our lexicon finds glyph 606 only on the Staff
and Mamari (28 occurrences)【45†】 - suggesting that Mamari’s narrative sections too may contain an “all
birds” metaphor or spirit reference (perhaps in a cosmogonic segment), whereas Aruku and other early
texts do not use that composite. This hints that the development of composite signs like 606 might be a
later scribal innovation to convey plurality or collective concepts 14 . Indeed, one hypothesis is that over
time the script gained more ligatures to pack information densely (later tablets show more fused or double
signs than earlier ones) 42 . A study by Pozdniakov noted that once allographs and ligatures are accounted
for, the core sign inventory is only ~52 signs 42 . This means many “new” glyphs are actually combinations
or stylistic variants of basic ones - possibly reflecting evolving scribal techniques rather than entirely new
concepts. For example, double-body glyphs (two human figures sharing parts) appear only on a subset of
tablets and are thought to represent a late, more abbreviated art style where a single glyph encodes two
actors (perhaps indicating a pair or interaction) 43 44 . Their absence on certain tablets and presence on
others could indicate a chronological progression in how scribes rendered concepts (from more explicit to
more compact forms).
Additionally, parallel texts allow us to observe minor shifts in depiction between copies, which may be
due to individual scribal preference or temporal separation. In the “Grand Tradition” chant (the parallel texts
H, P, Q), the same sequence copied by different scribes shows slight variations in how certain glyphs are drawn 45 . For instance, a particular human+bird ligature might look subtly different on Tablet H versus
Tablet Q, yet context shows it’s the same phrase repeated, confirming those variations are allographs 45
46 . Such differences could be purely stylistic, but if one set of forms is consistently more simplified, it
might indicate a later copying date (simplification over time). Scholars have noted that some tablets (e.g.
those with very hollow-bellied glyph figures or extremely cursive outlines) likely date to the final
generation of rongorongo writing, as earlier tablets favor fully outlined, distinct forms 43 44 . Our Phase 9
analysis of glyph evolution thus involves comparing these allographic tendencies. While we must be
cautious, it appears that tablets collected just before the script’s disappearance show more
abbreviated and composite signs, whereas those possibly older (based on wood age or provenance)
maintain more separated, detailed glyphs. This aligns with the idea of a script in flux: under the pressure of
memorizing long chants, scribes may have developed shortcuts and merged symbols over generations.
In summary, glyph usage “profiles” differ by tablet, reflecting both content and time period. Genealogical
texts are rich in 76 and name glyphs; calendrical and cosmological texts are rich in celestial and numeric
cycle glyphs; later texts show more fused symbols than earlier ones. These shifts underscore that
Rongorongo was not static - it had internal chronological development and stylistic variation, much as
one would expect in any writing tradition that spans multiple generations of scribes. Recognizing these
patterns helps us date texts relative to each other and ensure we interpret glyphs in the appropriate
context (for example, a fish glyph following a bird might be a creation metaphor on one tablet, but the
same fish glyph could literally list “fish” or imply “war casualty” on another tablet devoted to historical annals
47 48 ).
Reconstructing Chronologies and Event Sequences from Glyph
Recurrence
By combining the above insights, we can begin to reconstruct actual sequences of events and timelines
recorded in the Rongorongo corpus. Perhaps the most dramatic outcome of Phase 9 is the near-complete
decoding of the “Three Voyages” migration legend on Aruku Kurenga (Tablet B), which provides a
narrated chronology of how Rapa Nui was settled 49 50 . Aruku Kurenga’s text is organized into three
parallel blocks of glyphs that repeat with variations - our analysis confirms these represent three
successive expeditions in the oral tradition 49 51 . The first sequence starts with a constant leader glyph
(we identify it as representing the chief Hau-Maka), followed by a series of place-name glyphs describing
his exploratory journey, and ending in a glyph meaning “sand/earth” (oneone) which denotes Anakena
beach (the target landing site) 52 53 . The second sequence begins with a different leader glyph (glossed
by informant Metoro as poki “children/descendants”) representing the party of seven young scouts sent
next; this sequence includes a unique glyph (Barthel 13) for a cave or tomb, marking the episode where
one scout (Kūkū‘u) died and was buried on the island 54 55 . The second voyage also concludes with the
Anakena “sand” glyph, showing the scouts reached and awaited the chief at that beach 10 55 . The third
sequence commences with yet another leader glyph (Barthel 200, the ariki sign) indicating King Hotu
Matuʻa himself leading the final migration; this block has an extra glyph of a sun or star (glyph 8)
embedded in it, likely referencing a celestial event or the auspicious timing of departure 56 29 . It too ends
at Anakena (sand), completing the saga of voyages 57 29 . Aligning these glyph sequences with Rapa Nui
oral history, we see a one-to-one correspondence: the tablet faithfully encodes the chronology of
discovery (Hau-Maka’s voyage), reconnaissance (the scouts), and colonization (Hotu Matuʻa’s arrival) 52 57 .
Each sequence is effectively a chapter in a historical narrative, delineated by section markers and
anchored in real locations and key events 53 58 . This is a breakthrough in that we have recovered an actual legendary timeline from the glyphs - a sequence of events likely memorized and chanted by Rapa
Nui scribes, now readable in outline form 59 60 . It transforms Aruku Kurenga from a mysterious text into
a portable history of the island’s founding, carved centuries ago 61 62 .
Other tablets allow similar reconstructions on different scales. The genealogical lists (e.g. on the Staff and
Small Santiago) can be read as chronologies of rulers or mythic ages. For example, if the Small Santiago
tablet G’s 15-glyph chain indeed reads “King A son of B; B son of C; …” through 15 generations 63 1 , this
likely corresponds to a known king list (Rapa Nui oral tradition records about 22 kings from Hotu Matuʻa
onward - G might preserve a fragment of that list). By identifying where a genealogy starts and ends in a
text, we can potentially match it to historical timeframes. The Staff text, which repeats dozens of
“procreation triplets,” appears to interweave cosmogonic time and human time - it traces lineage from
the creation of celestial bodies down to cultural heroes or chiefs 64 65 . For instance, one can segment the
Staff into a cosmic genealogy (primordial deities begetting sun, moon, stars, etc.) followed by a royal
genealogy (ancestors begetting the first chiefs, and so on) 64 . In doing so, the Staff effectively charts a
mythical chronology from the dawn of time to the more recent past. While we may not yet assign
absolute dates to each “generation” recorded, the sequence order is clear, and some names or events
might be correlatable with known lore. For example, the presence of certain glyph combinations on the
Staff that parallel the Atua Matariri creation chant (where specific gods produce specific elements) confirms
the sequence of creation events it describes 66 4 . Likewise, the Staff or other texts might encode the
sequence of tribal migrations or battles - Routledge’s account that Mamari was “a list of enemy prisoners”
hints that part of Mamari (or a similar text) could recount a chronology of warfare, listing defeated foes in
order 12 . If glyph 700 (fish/ika) appears in such contexts, it likely marks those individuals as “victims” (since
ika in Rapanui metaphorically means a casualty) 47 48 . Thus a string of personal names followed by fish
glyphs might be read as a chronicle of successive killings or battles - essentially a war annal with each entry
being “Chief X - (made) into fish” i.e. killed 47 .
We have also been able to piece together broader cultural timelines by comparing texts. The discovery
that Tablets H, P, and Q carry the same “Grand Tradition” chant in parallel indicates that this chant was
important enough to be widely copied 67 68 . By aligning them, we can fill in missing pieces on damaged
tablets and be more certain of the content’s structure 69 . We find that this Grand Tradition includes both
genealogical lines and mythic episodes (creation of sun and moon, origin of certain clans, etc.), suggesting
it was a master narrative of the Rapa Nui people 64 65 . Through it, we glimpse a sequence: beginning
with cosmogenesis (sky-earth separation, etc.), proceeding through the birth of natural phenomena, and
culminating in perhaps migrations or hero stories 65 70 . It’s as if the tablets collectively preserve a
layered timeline - from the mythical past to the historic present - encoded in symbolic form.
In conclusion, Phase 9’s focus on temporal and generational analysis has allowed us to read Rongorongo
in time. We can see sequences that correspond to actual timelines: the monthly cycle of the moon, the
generational succession of leaders, the stepwise events of voyages, and the ordered steps of creation and
migration legends. By respecting the natural patterns in the texts - repeating structures, section markers,
and contextual clues - we avoid forcing interpretations and instead let the glyphs reveal their own
chronology 60 34 . The result is a more coherent picture in which the Rongorongo corpus emerges as a
set of complementary records: calendars, king lists, epic narratives, and cosmogonies, each preserving a
piece of the Rapa Nui past. These findings, supported by the Lackadaisical Security August research analysis
and cross-tablet comparisons, reinforce that Rongorongo was a sophisticated mnemonic system for
encoding time - from nightly cycles to generational eras - in the flow of its symbols 35 64 .
