# Analyzing Complex Rongorongo Passages and Layered Encodings

## Introduction

Rongorongo, the undeciphered script of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), contains several texts with highly repetitive or symbolically rich sequences that hint at structured content. Researchers have long suspected that certain passages encode genealogies, chants, calendars, or other formulaic texts. This report examines some of the most complex and ambiguous Rongorongo passages – notably from the **Santiago Staff (Text I)**, **Aruku Kurenga (Text B)**, and the **later sections of the Mamari Tablet (Text C)** – using a multi-method approach. We integrate:

* **Phonetic and Rebus Analysis:** Attempts to read glyphs as sounds or words (e.g. interpreting pictorial glyphs as Rapanui words).
* **Mythological and Ritual Symbolism:** Identifying glyphs that depict Polynesian deities, animals, or ritual motifs, which could hint at meaning.
* **Statistical Patterns and Position Analysis:** Examining glyph frequencies and positions (repetitions, suffixes, line positions) to detect formulas or syntax.
* **Cross-Tablet Correlation:** Comparing sequences across different tablets for parallels, and aligning them with known Rapa Nui lore (such as chants or genealogies).

We highlight evidence of **dual encoding** (glyphs serving both visual-symbolic and phonetic roles), **symbolic layering** (multiple levels of meaning), and **formulaic refrains** (repeated textual formulas) in these passages. The goal is to clarify how these complex sections could feed into a Rongorongo–English translation effort and comparative research.

## The Santiago Staff: Triplet Formulas and Dual Readings

**Text I (Santiago Staff)** – a 126 cm wooden staff inscribed with the longest Rongorongo text (≈2920 glyphs) – is especially enigmatic. It is unique in having **vertical line punctuation** dividing the text into segments. These divisions occur at irregular intervals (about 103 in total) and **nearly every segment contains a multiple of three glyphs**, usually **three glyphs per phrase**, with the **first glyph of each segment marked by a special suffix**. The suffix is **glyph 76**, which depicts a phallus and is attached to or following the first glyph of each triplet. An example segment mid-way through line 12 of the Staff is: **606-76 700 8**, a sequence of three glyphs (with 606 carrying the 76 suffix). This highly structured pattern has given rise to two leading interpretations:

* **Genealogical “Name-and-Lineage” List:** Early analysts Butinov and Knorozov proposed that glyph *76* (the phallus-like sign) is a **patronymic marker**, akin to “son of”. In this reading, each triplet encodes a personal name and lineage. For example, if *X-76 Y* appears, it could mean “X, \[child] of Y”. The third glyph in some triplets might denote an event or status (such as death). Indeed, Barthel noted that the Staff contains **564 occurrences of glyph 76** (the patronymic marker) – about one-quarter of all glyphs on the staff – and **63 occurrences of glyph 700**, a fish glyph which could rebus **īka** (“fish” in Rapanui, but also used to mean a **war casualty** or victim). If this interpretation is correct, the Santiago Staff might be largely a **list of names and their fathers**, possibly a *kohau îka* (war casualty register or genealogy) listing people and perhaps noting their fate. This genealogical hypothesis finds support in the **Small Santiago Tablet (Text G)**, whose verso contains a short **genealogy** that Butinov & Knorozov identified and aligned with Rapa Nui family lines. On that tablet, groups of glyphs each begin with a “Man” figure (glyph 200, likely the Rapanui particle **ko** marking a name) followed by two animal glyphs and ending with the phallus glyph 76. The second glyph of each group becomes the first of the next, forming an **ascending lineage** (e.g. “A – a B; B – a C”, meaning A child of B, B child of C, etc.). This precisely matches the structure of Rapa Nui genealogies recorded by missionaries (e.g. *“Honga a Tuu”* = Honga \[son] of Tuu). Each group on the Small Santiago ends with 76 *ure* (meaning **“penis, progeny, clan”** in Rapanui), reinforcing that it marks the father’s name. The **Santiago Staff** shows the *same glyph 76 at the end of hundreds of segments*, strongly suggesting it too is composed of such “name of X, child of Y” triplets. In this genealogical reading, the example **606-76 700 8** would decode as something like “Person 606, child of 700, \[was] killed” (since 700 *ika* “fish” would signify a victim or deceased). Notably, this aligns with Rapa Nui oral history that **tablets could record lineages or clan lists**. It also explains why glyph 76 is extremely frequent only on certain texts (the Staff, Small Santiago verso, and one Honolulu tablet) but **rare (<1%) in most others**. Those three texts seem dedicated to name lists, whereas other tablets likely serve different genres without the patronymic marker.

* **Cosmogonic or Creation Chant:** Conversely, Steven Fischer observed that every Staff segment begins with a glyph suffixed by the phallus (76), and hypothesized this indicates **copulation or union** as a recurring action. He identified the Staff text as a series of **mythological coupling statements** – essentially a creation chant where each verse is “X (with phallus) Y Z”, interpreted as *“X copulated with Y, producing Z.”* In Fischer’s reading of the same line-12 example **606-76 700 8**, glyph 606 (a bird-man figure with a hand) was read as **“all the birds”** (via a rebus: the hand motif = *maʻu* “to take” \~ plural marker **mau**, plus a bird glyph = “birds”). The phallus (76) means “mated with”, glyph 700 (fish) means “fish”, and glyph 8 (a circle or rosette) means “sun”. Thus the phrase becomes **“All the birds copulated with the fish; the sun was born.”**. This interpretation gains inspiration from a known Rapa Nui **chant called *Atua Matariri*** (recorded by Thomson in the 19th century) in which each verse follows the pattern **“X ki ai ki roto ki Y, ka pû te Z”** – literally, “X having been inside Y, Z comes forth”. For example: *“Atua-matariri ki ai ki roto ki a Te Poro, ka pû te poporo”* meaning “God Matariri by copulating with (goddess) Te Poro produced the poporo (nightshade plant)”. Fischer noted striking structural similarity between this Polynesian cosmogonic litany and the Staff’s triplets. He boldly concluded that **the majority of tablets (≈85%) are composed of such creation verses**, sometimes with the phallus omitted in later copies. By this view, the Staff is a lengthy **genealogical creation chant** enumerating mythic unions of sky, land, sea creatures, etc., giving birth to elements of the world. This aligns with the **Polynesian tradition of cosmogonic genealogies**, where natural phenomena and deities are born from unions of personified elements. It would imply a **symbolic layering**: e.g. **bird + fish = sun** could be metaphorical (perhaps referencing sky-father and sea-mother producing the sun in myth). Fischer’s approach treats many glyphs as **rebus symbols** (bird glyph = *manu* “bird”; fish = *ika* “fish”; phallus = *ure* implying *uꞌa* “to copulate”) to derive a phonetic Rapanui phrase.

**Dual-encoding and Ambiguity:** These two interpretations highlight the *ambiguity and potential dual encoding* in the Staff’s text. On one hand, it could be read as a **literal human genealogy or name list**, and on the other as a **mythical cosmology**. Notably, both readings utilize the **same glyph patterns** but assign different semantic roles: glyph 76 *“phallus”* is a **visual symbol of fertility** that in one case is a lineage marker (“of \[the father]”) and in another is an action (“mated with”). Similarly, an animal glyph like *700 (fish)* could be read as a clan name or victim (genealogy) vs. an actual fish in a myth (cosmogony). It is conceivable that the text was deliberately composed to **layer human and mythic genealogy together**, a technique found in Polynesian lore where aristocratic lineages descend from gods. For instance, scholars have noted that certain glyph chains on the Small Santiago tablet seem to list animal names (turtle, shark, octopus…) which correspond to **mythical ancestors** (the gods Rongo, Tangaroa, etc.). In that case, a *“turtle–shark”* pair of glyphs could simultaneously denote literal creatures and the names of legendary forefathers. Such **symbolic redundancy** – an animal glyph serving as both a pictograph and a divine name – exemplifies the multi-layered encoding in Rongorongo. Indeed, Rjabchikov (2022) interprets the Small Santiago genealogy as listing the divine forefathers **Rongo (represented by a turtle glyph) and his father Tangaroa (shark glyph)** among others. This suggests that the **visual motifs carry a mythological significance** beyond a purely phonetic reading.

**Statistical patterns** on the Santiago Staff support its formulaic nature but also illustrate the complexity. Each segment is usually three glyphs long, but with some exceptions; nearly all begin with glyph 76 as a suffix on the first glyph. The sheer frequency of certain glyphs (76, 700, etc.) on the Staff far exceeds their occurrence on other tablets, marking it as a distinct text category. Cross-comparisons show the Staff’s content **resembles only a couple of other texts**: notably, the **Small Santiago (G) verso** and the **Tahua tablet (A)** share similar repetitive patterns or glyph distributions. This hints that those may belong to the same genre (perhaps genealogical or ritual lists). Indeed, all three have high proportions of the patronymic/phallic glyph, implying a shared formulaic structure.

*In summary*, the Santiago Staff contains **layered encodings** that can be approached as **genealogical lists** *and/or* **cosmogonic chants**. It features **repetitive triplet phrases**, a **special suffix glyph (76)** that might function like a grammatical or semantic marker, and numerous **mythic-symbolic glyphs** (birds, fish, humans, etc.) that invite rebus interpretation. Table 1 below outlines these parallel interpretations for an example segment:

| **Example Segment (Staff line 12)** | **Genealogical Hypothesis** (Name List)                                                                                                                                        | **Cosmogonic Hypothesis** (Creation Chant)                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glyphs: **606-76 700 8**            | 606 = Person/Name “X”; **76** = “child of”; 700 = Parent “Y” (fish clan); 8 = status/result (perhaps death, if fish = *ika* victim).<br>*Reading:* “X, child of Y (deceased).” | 606 = “all the birds” (*manu mau* – bird + hand as plural “all”); **76** = “mated with”; 700 = “fish” (*ika*); 8 = “sun” (*ra‘a*).<br>*Reading:* “All the birds copulated with the fish, \[and] the sun emerged.” |

Both interpretations are supported by internal structure and Polynesian cultural parallels. Further cross-analysis is needed to determine if the Staff text was intended to carry a **dual meaning** (e.g. mythological genealogy of clans *equating to* cosmology), or if one of the readings is the “true” content. Regardless, the Staff’s **formulaic triplets and rich symbolism** make it a centerpiece for decipherment efforts. Its vertical separators and glyph suffixes provide clues to syntax, and its correspondence with known Rapa Nui chants provides a rare bridge between text and oral tradition.

## Aruku Kurenga: Poetic Structure and Repetitive Formulae

The **Aruku Kurenga tablet (Text B)**, a fluted wooden tablet with about 1135 glyphs, is another text exhibiting *structured repetition* and possible layered encoding. Unlike the Santiago Staff, Aruku Kurenga has no obvious engraved punctuation, yet analysis shows it contains **repetitive sequences and rhythmic patterns**. Scholars have identified two notable features in Aruku’s inscription:

* **Opening Formula:** Several Rongorongo tablets (including Aruku) begin with the *same sequence of glyphs*, suggesting a conventional **opening phrase** comparable to “Once upon a time…”. Davletshin (2022) notes that a particular sequence marks the start of narratives on multiple tablets, and when this sequence appears mid-text, it seems to herald a **new section**, implying some tablets record multiple texts back-to-back. On Aruku Kurenga, the very beginning likely contains such a **standardized opening**. This indicates a **formulaic introduction** was used in Rongorongo compositions – a clue to textual genre. Identifying and isolating this opener can help segment the text into meaningful units (just as recognizing a prayer’s intro vs. body).

* **Versified Passage with Refrains:** A remarkable discovery is that parts of Aruku Kurenga appear to be **verse-like, with regular line lengths and a repeating refrain**. In one section (transcribed by Horley and Davletshin), a glyph known as the **“Diamonds” sign (a rhomboid shape, Barthel glyph 2 variant)** recurs at the **end of successive lines**, sometimes doubled or tripled. This *Diamonds* glyph consists of two to four joined lozenges and does **not** correspond to any obvious word; its repetition at line ends suggests it might function like a **chorus or punctuation** in a chant. It is “unexpected of both grammatical markers and lexical roots” to appear in runs of two or three, so its presence hints at a **poetic or musical structure**. Essentially, Aruku Kurenga contains a **metrically structured passage**: lines of similar length, beginning with similar wording (anaphora), and ending in a *Diamond* glyph refrain. Guy (1982) and Métraux (1940) had earlier noted such poetic devices (rhythm, rhyme, parallelism) in Rongorongo texts, and Aruku provides concrete evidence of **verse composition**. This could mean the tablet records a **ritual chant or song** with a recurring chorus. The Diamonds glyph might signify a pause, a repetitive phrase (perhaps a filler syllable or exclamation in a song), or even a **numeric refrain** (if the lozenges have counting significance, as discussed below for Mamari).

The Aruku text also shows **repeated sequences with slight variations**, a sort of patterned repetition that may indicate **lists or enumerations**. For instance, researchers have long noticed that Rongorongo inscriptions often have **fixed glyph groups delimiting repetitive units**. Harrison (1873) and others observed that certain signs consistently appear as **separators or list markers**. If we examine Aruku Kurenga, we might find a glyph (or sequence) that recurs at regular intervals, possibly marking boundaries between verses or list items. One candidate is a **vertical stroke or staff-like glyph** that could act like a line-break (similar to punctuation on the Staff but without an actual engraved line). Indeed, Horley (2007) identified that parallel passages in Aruku and Tahua tablets helped deduce how **ligatured signs should be read in sequence**, implying that **line breaks or list markers** were present to align those parallels.

Cross-tablet comparisons reinforce Aruku’s structured nature. Some sequences in Aruku Kurenga reappear in **Tablet Tahua (Text A)** and others. For example, Barthel noted parallel texts: Tahua and Aruku share content where one can be used to help read the other. This suggests that at least parts of Aruku Kurenga were not unique to it, but rather **formulaic text copied or paraphrased across tablets**. Such repeated passages could be standard genealogies, common prayers, or well-known chants. The presence of these parallels means decipherers can attempt a **comparative analysis**: aligning the glyph sequences from Aruku with those on Tahua and identifying consistent substitutions or variants. If one tablet’s version has a slightly different glyph in the same position, that glyph might be an **allograph or synonym** for the other. This method has already been used to sort out allographs (variant forms) in the script.

From a **symbolic and phonetic perspective**, Aruku Kurenga likely encodes ritual or mythic content as well. We see many **anthropomorphic glyphs, bird-man figures, aquatic creatures, plants, and celestial symbols** scattered through its lines (based on Barthel’s published tracing). Each of these could carry a dual meaning: literal (the creature or object depicted) and nominal (the name of a figure or concept). For instance, if Aruku includes the turtle (glyph 68) and shark (glyph 730) together, a reader versed in Rapa Nui lore might recognize the **Tangaroa and Rongo** motif (as with the Small Santiago genealogy). Likewise, bird-man glyphs might allude to the **Tangata manu** fertility cult. Without a known decipherment, these remain hypotheses, but by **mapping glyph clusters to known Polynesian myth patterns**, we can propose interpretations. Aruku’s repetitiveness makes it a good candidate for containing **ritual lists** (like lists of gods, kings, or placenames recited in ceremonies).

In summary, Aruku Kurenga demonstrates **poetic and repetitive structuring** that points to a possible chant or recitative text. It likely uses **glyphic “rhymes” or refrains** (e.g. the Diamonds glyph) as a structural device. Decipherers should exploit this by treating Aruku’s text as possibly metrical: break it into lines at repeat signs, and see if each line or verse follows a template. This approach, combined with cross-correlation to other tablets that have parallel lines, can narrow down interpretations (for example, identifying which glyphs swap positions – maybe indicating synonyms or gender pairs in a chant).

## Mamari Tablet: Lunar Calendar and Symbolic Layering

The **Mamari Tablet (Text C)** is famed for containing the only segment of Rongorongo that scholars widely agree on the general meaning: a **lunar calendar**. This tablet (with \~1000 glyphs) has a section on side *a* (recto) lines 6–9 that clearly encodes the traditional Rapa Nui month cycle. The **later sections of Mamari** (including and following this calendar) are rich in repeated glyph patterns, *layered symbolic cues*, and what appear to be **numerical or “accounting” signs**, making it a prime example of layered encoding.

Key features of the Mamari text:

* **The Lunar Calendar Sequence:** Midway through line *Ca6* of Mamari, a structured sequence begins, continuing to the start of line *Ca9*. Thomas Barthel first identified this as a lunisolar calendar text. The sequence is characterized by **repeated moon glyphs** (crescent shapes) arranged in a regular progression, interspersed with other symbols. In total it encodes **30 nights** (the Rapa Nui lunar month of 28 nights plus 2 intercalary nights). The structure is as follows: small **crescent glyphs** (depicting lunar phases) are repeated in a series, periodically interrupted by a **heralding sequence** of four glyphs that marks divisions in the cycle. One of these four glyphs is a distinctive **fish-on-a-line symbol** which appears right at the end of each heralding sequence. Notably, the fish is carved upright in the first four occurrences (before the full moon) and **upside-down in the four occurrences after the full moon**, signaling the transition from waxing to waning moon. This clever **visual encoding** uses the orientation of a glyph to convey meaning (the inversion of the fish corresponds to the moon’s change of direction). Each heralding sequence also contains **two special crescent signs** (shaped like “☽”), and these coincide with the known traditional division of the Rapa Nui month into segments. In Rapa Nui lore, the nights of the month had names (often groups of nights shared a base name like *Kokore 1–6*). The Mamari calendar’s grouping of crescents reflects those groupings: e.g. a run of six crescents with no extra glyphs corresponds to the six numbered *Kokore* nights that lacked unique names. Crucially, within the calendar text appears a **pictograph of the full moon** – Barthel’s glyph *152* – which is depicted as a **round face with rays or an “old woman” figure** inside it. This glyph was recognized as *te nuahine kā ‘umu ‘a rangi* (“the old woman lighting the oven in the sky”), a Rapa Nui personification of the full moon. It corresponds to the widespread Polynesian “Woman in the Moon” myth (analogous to a Man in the Moon) and is explicitly described in Rapa Nui oral traditions. The inclusion of this **mythical pictogram** is a prime example of **symbolic layering**: the glyph is simultaneously a visual icon (an old woman figure, easily recognized) and a calendrical marker for the full moon night (the word associated with that myth). Surrounding this full moon glyph, the sequence encodes whether an extra night should be added before or after the full moon in that month. Guy (1992) deduced that Mamari’s calendar isn’t just listing the nights but also providing an **astronomical rule for intercalation** – essentially instructions on when to insert the 29th and 30th nights to keep the lunar calendar aligned. He noted that certain **half-sized crescents** and the arrangement of the heralding sequences seem correlated with the moon’s apogee (point of farthest distance, when the moon’s motion slows). In other words, *Mamari encodes both the calendar and the rules to adjust it*, using subtle glyph variations (size, orientation) as **code**. This is a sophisticated multi-layer encoding: glyphs carry literal meanings (moon, fish, etc.), but their placement and form convey additional data (astronomical observations). It’s noteworthy that **Mamari’s calendar is the only portion of Rongorongo “deciphered” to a functional level** – we understand its purpose (tracking lunar nights) even if we can’t phonetically read each glyph’s name. It stands as evidence that Rongorongo could encode complex, structured knowledge (like a lunisolar calendar) in a compact form.

* **“Accounting” Lozenge Sets:** Immediately following the calendar on Mamari, Barthel observed **multiple sequences of lozenge-shaped glyphs** – specifically *doubled and tripled lozenges*, sometimes with “beads” or ticks on them. These correspond to Barthel’s glyph 2 (often drawn as a stack of small rhombuses). Because of their appearance, Barthel dubbed them **“abacus-like accounting sets”**, suspecting they may represent **tallies or numerical information** appended to the calendar. For example, a *double-lozenge* glyph might mean the number 2 (or a period of two months, etc.), while a *triple-lozenge* means 3, etc. The fact that **several variants** (beaded, plain, etc.) occur suggests a systematic enumeration. These lozenge sets could be **summaries or results** related to the calendar – possibly counts of nights, months, or ritual cycles. They might also be a transition to a different text genre on the tablet. In any case, they introduce another layer of encoding: **abstract numerical or tabular data** represented iconically (much like an abacus or tally marks). If confirmed, this would demonstrate Rongorongo’s capacity for **numerical notation or record-keeping** alongside narrative content. It is intriguing that Mamari (Tablet C) is described as more pictorial than other tablets; the use of clear pictographs (moon, fish) and these apparent numeric signs bears that out. The presence of *lozenge tallies* in Mamari’s late section might parallel similar sequences on the Tahua tablet (Text A), where Horley (2011) noted **marked list delimiters** and counted items. It raises the question: could Mamari’s later lines be listing something like **genealogies or inventories** with each lozenge indicating a generation or count? The **cross-shaped “alii” glyph** also appears in Mamari after the calendar, which some have speculated might mean “king” or an honorific, possibly heading a genealogy. While speculative, these clues hint that Mamari’s latter half might segue from astronomy to history or myth (e.g. listing important events or chiefs in each lunar month).

* **Mythological Symbolism:** In addition to the moon glyph, Mamari’s text contains other rich symbols. The **heralding sequence** of four glyphs used repeatedly in the calendar likely encodes words or concepts that introduce each phase. One glyph in it is the **long-necked bird** (possibly a heron or frigate bird glyph) which is reversed in orientation after the full moon marker. The intentional reversal again suggests conveying the idea of “turning point” (full moon as turning from waxing to waning). Polynesian cosmology often assigns bird symbols to sky or seasons, so a bird glyph here could carry a dual meaning: literally indicating a phase change and phonetically part of a phrase like *“kokore”* (if the bird is read as manu, not likely, but as concept perhaps “sunrise bird” etc.). The **fish on a line** glyph at the end of the heralding sequence is reminiscent of a **fishing hook or caught fish**, which in some Polynesian cultures symbolizes *the passing of days* (as in Maui’s fish-hook pulling up islands or slowing the sun). It’s possible the fish glyph in this context is a rebus for *ika* which also meant a period or a victim – here maybe “finished” or “caught” night. This kind of symbolic layering – where each glyph in a recurring formula has both a pictorial role (moon, bird, fish) and a place in a **ritualized phrase or chant about the moon** – is very likely. In fact, Thomson’s informant recited a chant for the Rapa Nui months where many lines begin with **“Ko Hotu, ko Rongo,…”**, invoking legendary figures each month. If Mamari’s calendar had been fully deciphered phonetically, we might expect to see those names or invocations embedded in the glyph sequence. Instead, we have iconic stand-ins (an old woman for full moon, crescents for nights, etc.), implying Rongorongo may record **concepts and symbols rather than direct syllabic spelling** – a form of semasiographic (meaning-based) writing. This supports the idea that Rongorongo is a **mnemonic device with layered iconography and some phonetic elements**.

Overall, the Mamari tablet’s later sections illustrate a potent mix of **structured content (the calendar), visual symbolism (mythic figures), and possibly quantitative data (lozenge tallies)**. It shows the script can handle **complex, multi-level information**: e.g. the calendar encodes not just a sequence of named days but also an algorithm for adjusting the cycle. For a Rongorongo–English translation project, Mamari’s calendar would be a cornerstone, as it provides a partial **Rosetta Stone**: we can align glyph clusters with known day names (see Table 2 below for an illustrative subset). For instance, the sequence of four *“kokore”* nights (3rd–6th night) corresponds to a run of four identical crescent glyphs with no adjunct glyphs, whereas the special night *Atua* (11th) is accompanied by a unique glyph (possibly the word *atua* “spirit”). Such alignments offer hypotheses for phonetic values of those glyphs (e.g. one glyph might consistently appear with the *Rongo* nights, hinting it could read “rongo”). By tabulating all occurrences and cross-checking with the **Old Rapa Nui month names**, researchers can narrow down glyph meanings. Furthermore, any **formulaic refrains** in Mamari (for example, if each lunar phase section begins with the same “heralding” phrase) could be compared to refrains in other tablets to see if they were reused in non-calendrical contexts (maybe metaphorically).

| **☾☾** (two crescent glyphs) + … + **Fish (upright)** | *Atarangi* (New moon night, start of month) | Appears as **“heralding sequence”** marking month start. Fish upright (new/waxing phase). Two crescents perhaps denote start of a division (here, new moon).                                                                                                   |
| Series of **6 crescents** (no extra glyphs)           | *Kokore 1–6* (unnamed sequence of nights)   | Six identical crescent marks in a row correspond to six *Kokore* nights. No additional glyphs, consistent with these nights lacking individual names.                                                                                                          |
| **Half-sized crescent + 5 crescents**                 | *Hua* (10th), *Atua* (11th), etc.           | A small superscript crescent occurs before the 6th night before full moon, possibly indicating *apogee* (Guy’s hypothesis) and signaling intercalary logic. The 11th night *Atua* is followed by a distinctive glyph (meaning “god/spirit”) – a phonetic hint. |
| **Old Woman glyph (Full Moon)** = **glyph 152**       | *Ma’u* or *Mahe* (Full Moon night name)     | Pictorial glyph of **moon goddess** appears at mid-sequence, unequivocally marking full moon. Introduced by a heralding sequence; fish thereafter flip orientation (waning phase). Represents myth “old woman in the moon”.                                    |
| **Fish (inverted)** + **☾☾** (two crescents) + …      | *Hiro* (special intercalary nights)         | After full moon, heralding sequences have fish upside-down. The very end of the calendar has an **expanded heralding sequence** with two crescents signaling the two reserve nights (29th *Hotu* and 30th *Hiro*).                                             |

*(This table illustrates how specific glyph patterns in Mamari align with known calendar concepts. The actual phonetic reading of each glyph is still uncertain, but the structured repetition and cultural symbols give strong clues to their meaning.)*

The Mamari example underscores **how layered encoding works in practice**: iconographic signs (moon, fish) carry concrete meaning but can also serve as **rebus components** of longer phrases or as markers in a larger informational schema. It invites a decipherment strategy where one parses glyph sequences structurally (identify repeating frames, counts, orientations) and then maps those structures to culturally attested frameworks (here, the lunar calendar and mythology). By doing so, one can tease out both **literal content** (e.g. “this is about the moon cycle”) and **hidden content** (e.g. “observe the moon’s size on this night”).

## Cross-Correlation Insights and Hypotheses

Analyzing these complex passages side by side reveals several insights relevant to building a translator or conducting further research:

* **Distinct Text Genres in the Corpus:** It becomes clear that Rongorongo tablets are not all of one kind; instead, they likely record different genres (calendars, genealogies, chants, etc.). The Santiago Staff, Small Santiago (Gv), and perhaps the Honolulu tablet (hand B) form a *genealogical/list cluster* (all dominated by glyph 76 usage). Mamari and perhaps another tablet like *Keiti (E)* appear to have *astronomical or ritual instructions*. Aruku Kurenga and Tahua may record *mythic chants or narratives* (given their poetic devices and shared sequences). Recognizing these categories helps tailor decipherment approaches: e.g. genealogies will use repetitive name syntax, chants might use parallelism and refrains, and astronomical texts might use numeric patterns.

* **Formulaic Refrains Across Tablets:** Certain **formulae repeat across the corpus**, hinting at common content. For example, the **genealogy pattern** *“Name1 – a – Name2”* (with or without an explicit *a/ure* marker) found on Gv recurs in abbreviated form on the Staff and is likely present on the Honolulu fragment. Likewise, the **“X copulated with Y, produced Z”** formula proposed by Fischer, if not universally valid, *does* seem to appear at least on the Staff and possibly on the poorly preserved Tahua tablet. Another refrain might be the **opening sequence** (“long ago…”) which Davletshin found on multiple tablets. If one tablet’s opening sequence is known, any other tablet starting identically can be assumed to begin a new story or chant at that point, even if we can’t read it. This allows us to partition texts into sections reliably.

* **Name Signs and Semantic Determinatives:** The correlation of the **“Man” glyph (TB200)** with personal names on the Small Santiago genealogy suggests it acts like a determinative or marker for a proper name (similar to how Egyptian hieroglyphs had a man determinative for male names). It is noteworthy that this *Man/ko* sign does not appear before every name elsewhere, implying it might only be used in certain contexts (perhaps at the start of a list, or to disambiguate mythic names vs. other words). A translator algorithm could use this: if a sequence shows glyph 200 repeated at regular intervals, it might treat the following glyph(s) as a name segment. Similarly, glyph 76 (phallus/*ure*) appears to function like a **genitive or patronymic suffix** in distinctive texts, so its presence can signal a relational phrase (“of X”). Recognizing these could allow partial machine parsing of genealogical sentences: `[Name] [Name] 76` could be parsed as “\[Name] son-of \[Name]” tentatively.

* **Rebus and Phonetic Complements:** Rongorongo likely employs **rebus writing** – using a glyph for a word that sounds like the intended word. We saw Fischer use this logic extensively (e.g. hand = *ma‘u* punning *mau*, bird = *manu*, etc.). Not all his specifics hold up (critics note some homophones were Tahitian not Rapanui, etc.), but the principle is sound. For instance, glyphs of animals not native to Easter Island (e.g. turtles, octopus) were indeed carved – likely not because those animals themselves were being discussed, but because their names had significance (perhaps the name of an ancestor or a concept). The word for **turtle (*honu*)** is the name of a high ancestor (Rongo); **shark (*mango, or niuhi*)** ties to Tangaroa. The **Moon glyph (old woman)** is literally depicting a phrase (nuahine…kotekote) that encodes the concept of full moon. These cases show Rongorongo glyphs often wear two hats: **icon** and **phonetic sign**. Therefore, a decipherment strategy must allow for **phonetic complements** – small added elements to a glyph that hint at pronunciation. For example, some glyphs have **tiny tick marks or “feet”** that vary; Pozdniakov suggested these might differentiate phonetic values among otherwise similar symbols (akin to adding a vowel indicator). As an illustration, a star glyph with an extra line might mean a variant word (perhaps marking plural or tense). In Mamari, the difference between a normal crescent and a **smaller, superscript crescent** could be conveying a phonetic modifier (Guy interpreted it in terms of meaning – apogee – but it could correspond to a term like “little” or a grammatical particle). Table 3 compiles a few suspected **dual-encoded glyphs** that appear in our focus texts:

| **Glyph**         | **Visual Depiction**      | **Possible Meaning (Visual)**     | **Possible Phonetic/Symbolic Role**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **76** (Phallus)  | Male genital shape        | Fertility, masculinity, lineage   | *ure* = “penis; lineage, offspring” – used as patronymic **suffix** or verb “to beget”. Marks genealogical link or copulation action.                                                                                          |
| **200** (Man)     | Seated or standing person | Person or god (generic human)     | *ko* – focus/name marker in Rapanui. Appears before personal names in lists. Likely indicates start of a name or phrase (“here is…”).                                                                                          |
| **700** (Fish)    | Fish (various depictions) | Fish, sea creature                | *ika* – “fish” but also *ika* in Rapanui means **victim** or war casualty. In contexts like the Staff, likely a **metaphor for slain person**. In myths, fish could stand for the sea or a certain god.                        |
| **280** (Turtle)  | Sea turtle with flippers  | Turtle (animal)                   | *honu* – “turtle”. Symbol of the god **Rongo** (mythologically). Possibly used to write the name Rongo or the concept of “earth/peace” he represents.                                                                          |
| **730** (Shark)   | Shark or shark’s head     | Shark (animal)                    | *mango* or *niuhi* – “shark”. Associated with god **Tangaroa**. May denote Tangaroa’s name or ocean/creation.                                                                                                                  |
| **152** (Moon)    | Full moon with figure     | Full moon, lunar goddess (image)  | *hina* or descriptive phrase *nuahine…* (old woman). Stands for the Full Moon night in calendar. Probably a direct pictogram rather than phonetic, but its presence confirms the concept “full moon”.                          |
| **2** (“Diamond”) | Pair or trio of lozenges  | Not obvious (an object or design) | Possibly a **numeral** or **list marker** (like “item #”). Its repetitive use at line-ends in Aruku suggests a stylistic or mnemonic function. Could signal end of verse or a pause (maybe chanted as “hei” or similar sound). |

These examples show how our multi-method approach pinpoints likely values: by combining **cultural context** (mythology, language) with **positional analysis** (where the glyph occurs) and **visual reasoning**, we generate hypotheses that can be tested against other occurrences. For instance, if *turtle glyph 280* indeed means **Rongo**, we should see it in contexts where a god Rongo is expected – indeed, on Small Santiago it appears in a genealogical chain of mythical chiefs. If *fish glyph 700* means **“victim”**, tablets known as war lists should have it frequently – indeed the Staff does, and even **human skulls were found inscribed with glyph 700** in Rapa Nui, likely signifying a slain enemy. Such converging evidence strengthens these interpretations.

* **Parallel Texts and Bilingual Approaches:** Finally, cross-correlation has revealed that some tablets are near-duplicates or paraphrases of others. Barthel demonstrated that texts H (Large Santiago), P (Large St. Petersburg), and Q (Small St. Petersburg) share much of the same content, line for line. By aligning these, analysts have noted slight differences – different glyph shapes used in one copy vs. another – which can reveal **allographs or possibly different readings**. For example, a compound glyph on one might be split into two separate glyphs on another, telling us how scribes sometimes wrote a word either combined or split (which hints at syllabic vs logographic writing issues). Similarly, Small Santiago recto is parallel to the lost “Small London” tablet text, giving another comparative resource. These **near-identical texts** act like a *bilingual text* of Rongorongo to itself: any consistent variation might equate to a meaningful difference (like spelling the same word differently). For a translation project, feeding these parallel texts into a computer alignment algorithm could identify pairs of glyph sequences that correspond, allowing the inference of possible synonyms or phonetic variants. It’s akin to having multiple recensions of a chant – critical for reconstructing the “words” behind the glyphs.

In conclusion, the most complex Rongorongo passages – such as those on the Santiago Staff, Aruku Kurenga, and Mamari – reveal **layered patterns of encoding** when examined through multiple lenses. These texts are not random strings of symbols; they exhibit **syntax-like structure, repetition, and intentional iconography**. By applying phonetic guesswork, cultural knowledge, statistical analysis, and cross-comparison in tandem, we can begin to unravel their content:

* The **Santiago Staff** likely encodes a **structured list** (whether of ancestors or mythic pairs), with a repeating three-part syntax and a special glyph acting as a grammatical link. Its ambiguity (genealogy vs. chant) may stem from deliberate double-meaning or from our limited understanding – ongoing research seeks keys to decide between or unite these readings.

* **Aruku Kurenga** shows evidence of **oral literature** – possibly a song or story with verses – preserved in glyph form. The identification of poetic features (refrains, symmetrical lines) gives hope that we might eventually phonetically read a line if we recognize it as a known chant or narrative from Rapa Nui folklore.

* The **Mamari tablet** demonstrates Rongorongo’s capacity for **technical and ritual knowledge encoding**. It integrates a **calendar (astronomy)** with **mythology (the moon goddess)** and perhaps with **numerical recording**. Such complexity suggests a literate class on Rapa Nui that used the script for sacred knowledge (calendrics, genealogy, ritual).

Each method of analysis enriches the other: statistical pattern-finding points to where a rebus might be (e.g. unusual frequency of a glyph begs a functional explanation), while cultural context guides plausible readings (e.g. identifying a glyph as a known deity). The findings compiled here will support the development of a Rongorongo–English translation database by providing **templates for recurring phrases, candidate meanings for key glyphs, and a framework of text structures**. Future cross-correlation – including computerized matching of sequences between tablets – will further refine these hypotheses.

While full decipherment remains a challenge, focusing on these dense, repetitive passages is our best strategy. They likely hold the *“grammar”* of Rongorongo: the affixes, the proper name formats, the poetic constructions. By decoding the *layers of encoding* in them, we move closer to unlocking the script’s meaning, one refrain and one glyph at a time.
