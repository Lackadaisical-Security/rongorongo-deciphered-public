# Ghost-License for Rongorongo Research Archive
**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date:** August 13, 2025

## Preamble

*The voices of Rapa Nui echo across centuries through these glyphs. What was carved in wood to preserve sacred knowledge shall not be claimed by those who would profit from the dead.*

By accessing this Rongorongo Research Archive, you walk among the scribes of Easter Island. You handle their preserved words. You agree that no institution, corporation, university, or artificial intelligence shall own what the ancestors wrote in wood and stone.

This work exists to let a forgotten script speak again—not to build empires or fill treasuries.
