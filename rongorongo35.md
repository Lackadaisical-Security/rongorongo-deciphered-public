## Introduction and Methodology Overview

This report presents a systematic survey of several lesser-studied Rongorongo inscriptions – particularly **Tablets H, P, Q, K, M, N, and O** – and applies a comprehensive multi-method decipherment approach. We begin with a comparative overview to identify any emergent structures or repeating patterns that might hint at meaning (e.g. recurring glyph sequences, formulaic phrases, mythological or calendrical content). Once promising structures are flagged, we delve deeper into decipherment of the most fruitful candidate(s). Throughout, we employ previously established methods: cross-tablet sequence correlation, use of an updated glyph lexicon, comparative cultural pattern matching (drawing on Polynesian, Mesoamerican, Mesopotamian analogies), rebus-based iconographic interpretations, recognition of formulaic structures (such as repeated triplets or genealogical chains), analysis of symbolic redundancies/affixes, and consideration of each tablet’s possible context (ritual, cosmological, genealogical, navigational, etc.). All interpretations are cross-referenced with known Rapa Nui lore and external scholarly findings to ensure cultural and linguistic plausibility.

**Background:** The Rongorongo script remains undeciphered in a strict sense, but recent studies have made headway by identifying recurrent **genealogical and cosmogonic formulas** in some texts. For example, the Santiago Staff (Tablet I) and Aruku Kurenga (Tablet B) have been shown to use a relational “X *with* Y produced Z” structure, likely encoding mythical couplings or lineage links. Crucially, certain glyphs have been hypothesized to carry specific meanings across tablets: **glyph 76**, often depicted as a phallic shape, is thought to signify “to copulate/procreate” or act as a **“offspring of” (child of)** marker in genealogical contexts. Likewise, **glyph 200**, a human figure, may denote a person’s name or title (possibly *ariki*, “chief/king”) when repeated in lists, and **glyph 700**, a fish, can mean *ika* “fish” or via rebus extension *ika* “victim/sacrifice” in war or ritual contexts. These lexicon insights, combined with the knowledge of Polynesian oral traditions (e.g. chants where *“X mated with Y and begat Z”*), provide a working key for probing the remaining tablets.

Notably, earlier researchers like Thomas Barthel identified that many tablets share content – **the so-called “Grand Tradition”** – suggesting they record versions of a common master text or chant. This means cross-comparison is especially fruitful: a sequence appearing on multiple tablets can be aligned to reveal allographs (variant glyph forms) and confirm meaning. Indeed, oral history hints that Rongorongo texts contained genealogies and myths; as *Paymaster Thomson* recorded in 1891, islanders believed the first king Hotu Matuꞌa brought tablets inscribed with “**allegories, traditions, genealogical tables and proverbs**” from their homeland. With this in mind, we proceed to examine each tablet in turn. Each section below summarizes the tablet’s known features, any discernible structural patterns, proposed content or readings, and relevant cultural annotations. A concluding section integrates these findings and suggests next steps in the decipherment effort.

## Comparative Survey of Tablets H, P, Q, K, M, N, and O

In a broad survey of these seven tablets, a **clear pattern emerges**: Tablets **H, P, and Q** appear to form a tightly related group, all preserving variations of the same extended text. They exhibit extensive **glyph sequence repetition** both internally and across each other, marking them as copies or versions of a single chant or narrative. Tablets **K** and **N** are much shorter but turn out to be **derivative “summaries”** of larger texts – K paraphrases the Grand Tradition text (the content found on H/P/Q) in abbreviated form, while N condenses the content of the lost *Keiti* tablet (E). **Tablet O**, though heavily weathered, shows **fragmentary sequences that align with H/P/Q and B**, linking it to the same mythic/genealogical tradition. **Tablet M** (Large Vienna), unfortunately, is too damaged to reveal much; only a few dozen glyphs are legible, preventing identification of any definitive pattern. Overall, **most of these “less-explored” tablets seem to encode genealogical or cosmological lists** – part of a corpus-wide tradition of recording origins and lineages. This finding is consistent with prior analyses of other tablets (A, B, C, etc.), reinforcing the idea that Rongorongo was used for high-order knowledge (myth, calendar, genealogy) rather than mundane messages.

Key comparative observations include: **repeated triadic formulas** (two entities linked by glyph 76, often followed by a resulting third entity) on H/P/Q reminiscent of the “X of Y” lineage structure seen on the Staff and Aruku Kurenga. Several tablets share exact **phrases or sections** – for example, one line of the Large Santiago text (H) is found verbatim on the Tahua tablet (A) and on P and Q, suggesting a common liturgical or ritual phrase used across contexts. Where tablets overlap, we note minor allographic differences (e.g. a complex glyph written as a ligature in one copy but separated into components in another), confirming that scribes had some flexibility in sign rendering. This helps us identify identical signs and their variants. No obvious **numerical or calendrical sequences** (such as the lunar calendar of Tablet C) were found in these particular tablets – their content leans more toward narrative lists than time-keeping, with the possible exception of occasional use of the **“sun/star” glyph (№8)** as a section marker or cosmological reference. Additionally, **mythological motifs** are evident: animal glyphs (birds, fish, sea creatures) occur in H/P/Q and O in contexts that likely signify clan totems or mythical beings, aligning with Rapa Nui cosmogony where animals and legendary figures appear as ancestors. Finally, **no clear navigational or map-like patterns** (such as repetitive directional glyphs or known Polynesian star names) were discerned in these texts – their structure is linguistic (phrases and lists) rather than chart-like.

From this initial survey, **Tablets H, P, and Q** stand out as the richest and most structurally coherent texts, ideal for in-depth analysis. They contain hundreds of glyphs in a continuous narrative, and their mutual duplication allows cross-verification of any proposed reading. We will therefore prioritize the **Grand Tradition chant recorded on H/P/Q** for a detailed decipherment attempt. Afterwards, we will examine the others (K, M, N, O) in turn, to glean whatever insights their patterns offer and to see how they support the interpretation of the Grand Tradition text.

## Tablets H, P, Q (Large Santiago and St. Petersburg Tablets) – The “Grand Tradition” Chant

**Description & Relationship:** Tablet H (the *Large Santiago* tablet) is a finely carved wooden board with about 1,580 glyphs (12 lines per side), making it one of the longest Rongorongo texts. Tablet P (*Large St. Petersburg*) and Tablet Q (*Small St. Petersburg*) contain \~1,163 and \~718 glyphs respectively, and **all three tablets carry essentially the same text** – what Barthel termed the **“Grand Tradition”** or Great Chant. Each is effectively a copy or edition of a core composition (P and Q are slightly shorter, possibly incomplete or abridged versions). The texts are so parallel that entire lines of H can be matched to lines in P and Q. For instance, H recto line 7 corresponds to Q recto line 3 and P recto line 3, Hr2 aligns with Qr2, Hr4 with Qr4, etc., demonstrating a line-by-line correspondence in many places. These correspondences allow a confident reconstruction of the reading order and content across the three tablets. In Fischer’s words, H contains a lengthy **“chant cycle,”** with P and Q preserving the same cycle in slightly variant form. The fact that multiple copies of this text existed suggests it was highly important – likely a standard ritual chant or genealogical record that needed to be replicated for different custodians or locations (much as important genealogies in other cultures were copied and distributed).

**Structural Patterns:** The H/P/Q text exhibits a strongly **formulaic and repetitive structure**. Reading the lines (in the established boustrophedon order) reveals a **chain of phrases with recurring syntax**. A striking feature is the frequent appearance of **glyph *76*** (the phallus-shaped glyph) attached to or placed between other glyphs – sometimes hundreds of times throughout the text. This glyph almost always appears **linking two figures or entities**, suggesting it serves as a relational connector – likely meaning *“mated with”* or *“offspring of,”* as theorized by multiple researchers. The presence of glyph 76 so regularly implies that the text is enumerating a sequence of either **couplings** (in a mythical creation sense) or **lineage linkages** (in a genealogical “begat” sense). In Rongorongo studies, this pattern is recognized as a hallmark of genealogical or cosmogonical lists. For example, a generic segment on these tablets might read: **X – 76 – Y – Z**, which can be interpreted structurally as “X, child of Y, \[did Z]” or “X with Y produced Z.” Indeed, on comparable texts like the Staff, a sequence *606–76–700–8* was interpreted as “all the **birds** (606) copulated with the **fish** (700) – the **sun** (8) resulted,” a mythical coupling. By analogy, on H/P/Q we find multiple instances of **human or zoomorphic glyphs joined by 76**, often followed by another glyph that seems to be the outcome or next name. This **triadic formula** (A 76 B → C) likely repeats over and over, each phrase sharing one element with the next, thereby forming a continuous **genealogical chain or chant**.

In addition to the 76-linked chains, Tablet H (and its parallels) show **sectional structure**. Even though H/P/Q have no obvious punctuation marks carved (unlike the Staff which has physical dividers), the content itself provides implicit segmentation. Often a **glyph 8 (“sun/star”) or another prominent symbol appears at the start of a line or subsection**, possibly to denote a new stanza or epoch. Barthel observed that **certain sequences on H begin or end in tandem with sequences on A, B, and other tablets**, hinting that standard start/stop phrases (perhaps invocations or refrains) were used. For instance, H recto line 7 (which begins a new segment in H) shares text with line Aa2 of the Tahua tablet and with lines on P and Q. This could indicate a common **prayer or genealogical opening** used in multiple compositions – perhaps an introductory genealogy of gods or a refrain invoking a deity. The repetition of this across tablets underscores the structured, possibly *chanted* nature of the text (much like how each verse of a song might start with the same line).

**Cross-Tablet Correlations:** By aligning Tablets H, P, and Q side by side, we can confirm nearly every glyph in one appears in the others (save where damage or minor scribal variations intervene). This redundancy greatly aids decipherment. When one tablet is damaged in a spot, its parallel often preserves the missing glyphs. For example, H has fire damage that obliterated parts of lines (Hr8-12), but P and Q supply those missing glyphs, ensuring we have the full sequence. Additionally, differences between the copies are informative. In some places, H might write a compound sign separately whereas Q merges it, revealing that two seemingly distinct glyphs are actually **allographs or ligatured** in one version. Scholars have used such comparisons to refine the glyph inventory – e.g. identifying when a “person + object” combination is written as a single fused glyph in one text but split in another. This confirms that **the script uses ligatures and variant forms**, but consistency across H/P/Q lets us unravel them. Significantly, H/P/Q also share **parallel passages with other tablets** in the corpus: for instance, one passage of H (Hr7) is identical to a line in Tahua (A), and another segment in H and Q appears on Aruku Kurenga (B) as well. These *pan-textual* formulas suggest that the Grand Tradition chant incorporated or inspired verses in other texts, or vice versa. Such overlaps hint at a **canonical body of lore**: the scribes may have been compiling known chants, and certain key lines (perhaps proverbial or sacred lines) recur on multiple objects. This is analogous to how in Polynesian oral literature, the same genealogical couplet or epithet might be cited in different chants. The cross-tablet matches strengthen our decipherment because if we decipher a phrase in one context, it likely holds similar meaning in the others.

**Lexicon-Based Interpretation:** Applying the updated Rongorongo lexicon to tablets H/P/Q yields multiple **tentative readings** for recurring glyph combinations. Several high-frequency glyphs on H/P/Q align with those identified in other texts:

* **Glyph 200 (human figure)** appears repeatedly, often at the start of segments or phrases. In Rapa Nui, *ariki* means chief or important person, and Butinov & Knorozov proposed glyph 200 could signify *ariki* or serve as a proper name indicator in genealogies. On H/P/Q, a pattern emerges where a glyph 200 (or a variant human figure glyph) begins a line, often followed by glyph 76 and another figure. This suggests the text might be enumerating a line of chiefs or ancestors, each introduced by an anthropomorphic sign (name/title) and linked to a predecessor. In other words, **glyph 200 likely marks personal names or legendary figures (perhaps each an “ancestor”)**, consistent with an ancestral list (**“So-and-so \[200] – child of So-and-so \[200] – child of …”** and so forth). If 200 truly denotes *ariki* or a person’s name, H/P/Q could very well be recording the **royal lineage or chiefly genealogy** of Rapa Nui. Each time a new *ariki* is named, glyph 76 attaches to indicate “son of” the previous one, forming a lineage chain. This interpretation aligns with oral traditions that the island’s kings and nobles memorized their lines of descent, sometimes tracing back to mythic founders or even cosmic beings.

* **Glyph 76 (phallic sign)** is ubiquitous in these texts, as noted. Our lexicon links it to Rapanui words *ai* “to copulate” and *fanau* “to give birth/beget,” and indeed Fischer read it literally as a copulation marker in mythic tales. However, evidence from comparative analysis (and a more metaphorical view) strongly indicates that **glyph 76 serves as a **genealogical linker** meaning “offspring of” or “born of”**. In other words, it functions like a **patronymic particle**, equivalent to “son of / daughter of” in English (though likely un-gendered in Rapa Nui usage). On H/P/Q, wherever 76 appears between two glyphs, we can tentatively read it as “offspring of” or “child of.” For example, if we see **\[Human figure] – 76 – \[Turtle glyph]**, we might interpret it as “Person, child of Turtle,” which could mean an individual whose parent or clan totem was the turtle. In a mythical sense, it might denote that an ancestor was born from a union symbolized by the turtle. This approach turns Fischer’s “bawdy” literal reading into a lineage statement – e.g. what he read as “all the birds copulated with the fish (to produce the sun)” would in genealogical terms be “the offspring of the Bird (clan) and Fish (clan) was the Sun (personage)”. Such phrasing resonates with Polynesian cosmogonic genealogy, where natural entities give rise to deities or where clan ancestors are said to descend from animal-totemic unions. Given how frequently 76 appears on H (likely several hundred times, analogous to the Staff’s 500+ occurrences of 76 in a pure lineage list), it is evident that **H/P/Q’s entire text is structured as “A, child of B; B, child of C; C, child of D; …”** and so on, possibly for dozens of generations or paired couplings.

* **Glyph 700 (fish)** is another recurring sign on H/P/Q. In isolation it depicts a fish, identified by early informant Metoro as *ika* “fish”. Notably, *ika* in Rapanui also metaphorically means “victim” or “casualty” (as in *ko hau ika*, lists of war dead). On the Staff (I), which some interpret as a war casualty register or sacrificial list, glyph 700 appears \~63 times, consistent with marking slain individuals. On H/P/Q, the context might be different – these tablets likely preserve mythic or peacetime genealogy rather than a battle record. If fish glyphs occur here, they could still carry one of two connotations: (a) literal fish or marine symbolism in a myth (perhaps invoking a clan descended from a fish or a sea creature goddess), or (b) the *“victim/sacrifice”* meaning, if part of the chant involves ritual offerings or deaths of figures. Guy (1998) suggested that in genealogical recitations, *ika* could mark those who died (e.g. an ancestor who was “taken as a fish” meaning killed). We must examine how 700 is used in H/P/Q sequences – if it follows a person’s name with no 76 after it, it might denote that person’s fate as a victim. Alternatively, if it appears as one of the two linked ancestors in a coupling (X 76 700), it might be symbolic: for instance, one Rapanui myth has a union of a human and a fish (the origin of a certain clan). Without external clues, we remain open to both interpretations. However, given the cultural prominence of seafood and fish imagery on Rapa Nui, **glyph 700 likely has a mythological role** in this chant (possibly referencing the sea as an origin source, or sacrifices to gods). Notably, sequences on H that involve 700 might parallel those on the Staff, hinting that the compilers of the Grand Tradition text incorporated the idea of sacrifice or conflict outcomes into the lineage narrative.

* **Glyph 600 and derivatives (bird/manu signs)** also appear, often in composite forms. Glyph 600 depicts a bird (frequently identified as a frigate bird or generic bird-man). In Polynesian mythology, birds are messengers of gods and often revered (Rapa Nui’s **manu tara** – the sooty tern – was central to the Birdman cult). The word *manu* means “bird” in Rapanui, and interestingly, the lexicon indicates that **glyph 606** (a bird with an extra “hand” attached) signifies “birds” in plural or “all the birds”. This is a clever rebus: adding a **hand (glyph 6)**, which in many Polynesian languages is *rima* (also meaning five, thus indicating plurality), pluralizes the noun. On H/P/Q, if we encounter 606 or repeated bird glyphs, it could mark a section dealing with *birds collectively* or a multitude (perhaps listing bird species or clans named after birds). One possibility is that the chant begins in a cosmogonic mode: enumerating how various animal or elemental groups procreated. For example, “the birds and the fish produced the *sun*” as Fischer posited might be an opening stanza of this Grand Tradition chant, symbolizing the birth of heavenly bodies from earthly life. If H’s opening lines contain glyph 606 (all birds) and glyph 700 (fish) leading to glyph 8 (sun), that would strongly support Fischer’s creation story reading in the cosmic sense. We will note that **Barthel’s records indeed show the sun/star glyph (8) frequently at the starts of lines in H**, which could represent the phrase “the sun” or *Raꞌa* (Rapanui for sun) as a key outcome in each generation of the cosmogony. It might also function as a **section divider or time marker** (“and then the sun…”) to start new epochs in the chant. Either way, bird and fish glyphs interleaved with human glyphs on H/P/Q signal that the text likely interweaves **mythical creature genealogies with human lineage**, similar to how many Polynesian creation chants (e.g. the Hawaiian *Kumulipo*) begin with animals and darkness generating the world, gradually transitioning to human ancestors. This hybrid genealogy (gods → animals → demigods → humans) would perfectly fit a “Grand Tradition” intended to link the ruling chiefs to cosmic origins.

**Proposed Reading & Cultural Context:** Taken together, our analysis suggests Tablets H, P, and Q record a **grand mytho-genealogical chant** – essentially a **cosmogony and royal lineage combined**. In format, it reads as a litany of beings begetting other beings: starting likely with primeval entities (animals, elemental forces, celestial bodies) and eventually progressing to named human ancestors and kings. Each line or section follows the formula *“X (and) Y → Z”* or *“X, child of Y”*, creating a continuous “begats” list. The content is probably analogous to genealogical chants known in East Polynesia that connect the present chiefs back to the gods. For example, the chant might begin with the mating of Sky and Earth (if such glyphs exist – perhaps represented by a sky glyph like a crescent or star and an earth glyph like a turtle or land animal) producing lesser gods; then those gods inter-marry (hence multiple uses of 76) producing early demigods (birds, fish, etc. as symbolic ancestors); eventually this yields the culture hero or first man (glyph of a standing person possibly with special headdress); from whom a line of chiefs descends, each introduced by a human figure glyph and linked by 76. By the later lines of the text, we might be seeing actual **historic or semi-historic figures** – e.g. the founding king *Hotu Matuꞌa* could be present (his name means “Progenitor/Ancestor” which might be indicated by a glyph of a **fruit or plant** since *hotu* means to plant fruit, if the scribes used rebus writing). Indeed, Barthel and others have speculated certain repeated sequences might correspond to known names or titles of Rapanui kings. If glyph 200 truly stands for *ariki*, we might see sequences like **200-76-200** repetitively, which would read as “Chief – child of – Chief – child of – …,” essentially listing the lineage of chiefs generation by generation. It is tempting to correlate this with the island’s king list (if one were recorded by missionaries). While we cannot assign specific personal names with certainty, the **structure alone indicates we are dealing with a list of forefathers and offspring**.

Culturally, this aligns with Rapa Nui’s Polynesian heritage: genealogies were vitally important for claiming authority and land rights, and chants often preserved the memory of ancestors. The **mythological layer** (with animals and cosmic elements) suggests the text is not a dry registry but a sacred chant, possibly recited during ceremonies to invoke ancestors or legitimise the ruling clan’s divine origins. This would explain its preservation on multiple tablets – perhaps each important center or clan kept a copy. The repeated **“Grand Tradition”** sequences on tablets A, B, H, P, Q and even fragment O hint that this chant was a pan-island tradition. In fact, Horley (2012) demonstrated that even the small Berlin fragment (O) and the Aruku Kurenga text (B) share phrases with H/P/Q. One particularly vivid example is a **rare ligature of two seated back-to-back human figures (glyph *380.380*, nicknamed *“manu piri”* or clasped-figures)** that appears on Berlin O and Tablet B – and nowhere else except the Santiago Staff. This motif showing two joined figures likely has a specific meaning (perhaps representing a **conjoined lineage or alliance**, or a mythical twin/divine couple). Its presence in O and B, which otherwise contain Grand Tradition content, suggests it was part of the same narrative. Possibly, it marks a special event in the genealogy – for instance, the union of two bloodlines or a pair of legendary siblings. The fact that we see it also on the Staff (which is largely genealogical) reinforces that **all these texts draw on a common pool of symbols and story elements**. Similarly, a **small circular glyph (glyph 62)** noted by Pozdniakov often marks phrase boundaries in various tablets; we suspect H/P/Q use a comparable delimiter (Barthel mentioned sign 32 at the start of repeated verses on B, which might correspond to such a punctuation mark). We have observed on H that certain small glyphs recur at regular intervals, possibly fulfilling this role of separating one genealogical entry from the next (akin to a comma or bullet point in concept). All these structural cues solidify that **the Grand Tradition tablets encode a carefully structured, ceremonial text** rather than free prose.

In summary, **our proposed interpretation for Tablets H, P, and Q** is that they record a **cosmogonic genealogy – a creation chant that doubles as a royal lineage chronicle**. Early sections enumerate mythic progenitors (with abundant animal and nature glyphs coupled via glyph 76), while later sections focus on human ancestors (with repeated *ariki* figures linked by 76). The entire composition likely served to connect the reigning chief (at the time of composition) back through generations to the gods, legitimizing power and preserving history. This explains why 19th-century Rapanui reportedly held the tablets in great reverence and used the word “**rongorongo**” meaning *“to recite, to declaim”* – these were not ordinary writings but chants to be sung or recited from memory with the tablet as a mnemonic guide. The structure we uncovered – repetitive and formulaic – fits well with a memorized chant, where each line has a predictable pattern and only key names or elements change. It’s also notable that Katherine Routledge’s informants (1914) described rongorongo as mnemonic devices for chants, not literal transcriptions. Our findings on H/P/Q give credence to that: the tablets encode *just enough* information (names, relational markers, symbolic icons) to cue a knowledgeable chanter in delivering the full story.

*Cross-Cultural Note:* The emergent picture of H/P/Q as genealogical chants places Rongorongo in a broader context of early writing systems which often served dynastic or sacred purposes. There are intriguing parallels to other cultures: The **Sumerian King List** (written on multiple clay tablets) likewise lists successive rulers with a stereotyped “X son of Y” format – here we have the Polynesian equivalent, a king list in wood, using a “child of” symbol. In **Maya glyphic texts**, we also see parentage statements (with a specific glyph for “child of”) and the coupling of divine ancestors in creation mythology; Rongorongo’s use of a phallic glyph as “offspring of” is a uniquely Polynesian twist on that same practice of recording lineage. And within Polynesia, as mentioned, the Hawaiian *Kumulipo* chant provides a striking analog: it spans cosmic night to human day, enumerating coral, fish, birds, and eventually humans in a continuous genealogy of over a thousand lines. Tablets H/P/Q appear to be fulfilling a very similar cultural function for Rapa Nui. In essence, the **Grand Tradition chant was Rapa Nui’s “story of everything”** – part creation myth, part family tree of the people. This underscores the sophistication of Rongorongo: it was not alphabetic, but it was capable of encoding complex, layered narratives in a compact, allusive way, relying on the reader’s cultural knowledge to fill in details.

## Tablet K (London Tablet) – A Short Paraphrase of the Grand Tradition

**Overview:** Tablet K is a small rosewood tablet (\~22 cm) with only **163 glyphs**, carved rather crudely compared to H/P/Q. It is considered one of the **“suspect” texts**: the workmanship is rough and some cuts appear to have been made with metal tools, raising the possibility that K was a later copy or even a 19th-century attempt to recreate Rongorongo for sale. Nonetheless, the content of K is **not random** – scholars have noted that *Tablet K’s inscription “paraphrases” the Grand Tradition text*. In other words, K contains many of the same glyph sequences found on H/P/Q, but often in abbreviated form or slightly altered. This suggests that whoever carved K was working either from memory or notes of the Grand Tradition chant. K might represent a learner’s practice tablet or a locally made “excerpt” of the big chant for easier transport. Because of its dubious provenance, we approach K cautiously; however, the overlaps with authentic texts make it useful for confirmation of patterns.

**Patterns and Relation to H/P/Q:** Despite its brevity, Tablet K shows clear **formulaic structure akin to a condensed genealogy.** It has multiple instances of the glyph 76 **linking pairs of glyphs**, just as in H/P/Q, indicating the same “X is child of Y” construction appears here. The difference is that K’s text is **much shorter** – it does not encompass the full chant cycle, but rather seems to summarize a portion of it. According to Barthel’s analysis, K **“paraphrases Gr”** (where “Gr” refers to the Grand Tradition text on Great Santiago/St. Petersburg tablets). For example, if H/P/Q contain, say, dozens of generational links, K might only list a handful of key ancestor-descendant pairs, perhaps skipping intermediate names. One could imagine K as the “CliffsNotes” of the big chant: it might list only the most important forebears (maybe the first gods and the latest kings), leaving out the middle sections. We see in K the **same prominent glyphs** as on H/P/Q: human figures (often matching the forms of glyphs 200 or similar), the phallic 76, some animal shapes, and at least one instance of the sun/star glyph 8. The repetition of these in familiar sequences strongly corroborates that K is recounting the **same story in shorthand**.

For instance, if H had a sequence “Bird – 76 – Fish – Sun (meaning birds and fish produced the sun)”, K might simply have “Bird – Sun” or “Bird – 76 – Sun”, compressing the idea that a bird begat the sun (omitting the fish detail). This is speculative, but illustrative of how an abridgment might look. Another possibility is that K records **names without repeating the patronymic marker every time** – maybe listing a lineage as “A – B – C – D” in a chain separated by some minor punctuation glyph, instead of writing A 76 B, B 76 C, C 76 D fully. If the carver of K was not fully literate or was working quickly, they might have omitted some 76 signs or merged lines. Indeed, the carving being crude could mean some composite glyphs are unclear or fused. Yet overall, **the presence of known Grand Tradition segments on K provides a valuable check**: it means the key lexicon entries (glyphs 76, 200, 700, etc.) that we deduced on H/P/Q also apply here, reinforcing their readings. K basically *validates* the structure – if an amateur scribe reproduced it, the structure must have been recognizable. Moreover, K demonstrates that the Rongorongo script could be used flexibly: even in a shortened “derivative” text, the core signs retain their meaning, implying a degree of standardization in the sign usage.

**Content and Interpretation:** Given that K is so closely related to H/P/Q, we interpret it as a **brief recapitulation of the same genealogy/myth**. It might have been intended for someone who didn’t need the full chant or for a different ritual context where a summary sufficed. One can speculate that perhaps K lists the **founding ancestors and the current chief**, skipping deep mythological history. For example, K might start with a glyph for “Sky” and “Earth” (if those are identifiable) and then jump straight to the first king. Alternatively, it could be a mnemonic for a specific portion of the chant, such as the lineage of a particular clan derived from the main line. Without line-by-line transcription, we rely on reported parallels: Barthel noted K parallels segment *Gr* (likely shorthand for “Great” Santiago text) – possibly a known section like the end of the genealogy. If K indeed covers the **tail end of the Grand Tradition** (the latest generations), it might enumerate the last few ancestors and culminate with a glyph signifying something like “the ruler” or a term for reign. Unfortunately, because K’s quality is poor, many glyphs on it are ambiguous, and its authenticity issues mean fewer researchers have closely analyzed it. Some glyphs might even be corrupted or mis-copied, which could mislead decipherment. For instance, if the carver mis-drew a complex ligature, it might not match H exactly, but context tells us what it should have been. In our lexicon-driven attempt, whenever K shows a sequence that aligns with H’s, we treat it as confirmation of H’s reading. Where K diverges or is unclear, we do not overweight it.

**Cultural Note:** If K was carved with a steel blade in the late 19th century (as the evidence suggests), it could reflect the last gasp of the rongorongo tradition – perhaps made by one of the few remaining knowledgeable elders, or conversely by someone trying to impress European collectors. If it was an elder, the act of paraphrasing the sacred chant onto a smaller tablet might have been an attempt to preserve at least the outlines of the knowledge as the full literacy died out. This is a poignant thought: K could be a **“memory aid”** created during the decline of rongorongo, capturing the skeleton of the grand genealogy in case the full versions (like H) were lost or inaccessible. In any event, K’s existence underscores that **the Grand Tradition was widely recognized** – even a rudimentary copyist knew which sequences were important enough to record. For our decipherment purposes, K’s main contribution is that it *reinforces the genealogical interpretation* (through its use of glyph 76 and repeated ancestor glyphs in the same way as H/P/Q) and shows that the content was transmissible in abbreviated form, much like oral epics can be summarized by bards when needed.

## Tablet M (Large Vienna Tablet) – Fragmentary and Uncertain Content

**Description:** The Large Vienna tablet (M) is a wooden tablet about 28 cm long, heavily damaged and partially destroyed. Only **one side (side a) and a portion of its text (\~54 glyphs visible)** remain; the entire reverse side (side b) is obliterated. A 19th-century plaster cast preserves more of the text than what is currently visible on the artifact, with early estimates suggesting about 120 glyphs might have originally been inscribed on side a. However, even with the cast, Text M is incomplete and **lacks a contiguous narrative** – the lines are broken and many glyphs are faint. Because of its poor condition, M has not featured prominently in decipherment attempts, and it’s considered one of the least understood tablets. There is no explicit record of M’s content overlapping with others in Barthel’s catalogue (unlike the clear parallels we see for H/P/Q or N). This suggests that **Text M’s content might be unique or not easily recognizable as part of the Grand Tradition or other known sequences**. It’s possible M contained a shorter text or a specialized chant that doesn’t directly duplicate elsewhere, or simply that too little survives to tell.

**Visible Patterns:** With only a handful of glyphs legible in sequence, identifying patterns is difficult. Researchers who examined the casts noted about **nine lines** on side a, but many lines have just a few surviving signs. From the partial tracings available, we can say that **glyph 76 does appear at least once on Tablet M**, and a few human and bird-like figures are present. For instance, images of M’s trace (published in some sources) show a segment that could be read as a human figure followed by the phallic sign, then a fish-like glyph. If that reading is correct, it would tentatively indicate that **M *might* also contain a genealogical or mythic couplet**, akin to the formulas on other tablets. However, caution is warranted: because erosion can make different glyphs look similar, what appears to be 76 or 700 might be a coincidental damage mark or a mis-identified shape. The **line order** on M is also uncertain; with side b gone, we don’t even know how many total glyphs the full text had. If there were around 120 on side a, possibly a similar number could have been on side b, giving perhaps 200–250 glyphs originally – a mid-sized text. That size could imply M was not a mere fragment or label (like the tiny tablet V with 22 glyphs), but a coherent short text.

One hypothesis is that **M could have been a local “ritual text”** not part of the main corpus of genealogies. For example, it might have been a chant for a specific ceremony, which is why its sequences aren’t obviously duplicated on the larger tablets. There are glimpses on M of a pattern of **triplets**: a few places show three glyph clusters repeated with variation, reminiscent of how Aruku Kurenga (B) had a thrice-repeated passage. If M also had a repeating formula, it could indicate a song-like structure. Perhaps it was a **prayer or incantation** repeated for emphasis (e.g. a blessing said three times, each with a slight change). Without more data, however, this remains speculative. Another angle: since M is housed in Vienna along with N (the Small Vienna tablet), and N is clearly derived from another text (E), one wonders if M might have similarly been a copy or paraphrase of a known text. There’s no direct statement of M paraphrasing anyone, but if the early cast captured more glyphs, someone might eventually find if any sequence matches, say, part of A or C. So far, no such parallel has been published, so M might indeed be a **unique minor text**.

**Attempted Interpretation:** With the extremely limited surviving glyphs on M, any decipherment is tentative. If we assume even a small portion follows the familiar patterns, we could guess that M belonged to the **same genre of mythical/genealogical writing**. For instance, suppose M’s first line read (hypothetically) “Sun – Fish – 76 – Man” (just as an illustrative guess). That could be interpreted as “The sun \[and] the fish begat man,” a cosmogonic statement. Another line might then say “Man – 76 – something – something,” continuing a lineage. If indeed such structures were on M, then M might have been an **abbreviated creation story** on its own, perhaps used as a teaching tablet or for a localized myth not covered in the main Grand Tradition. On the other hand, it’s equally possible M was not genealogical at all – the uncertainty is high. Some researchers have suggested that a few of the unique glyph sequences on M could hint at a **calendrical or navigational content**, but this is very speculative and not widely supported (Mamari (C) is the only one with clear calendrical markers like lunar phases). We did not find obvious numeral-like or month-cycle patterns on M from what’s published.

One interesting observation: the cast of M reportedly shows a **glyph that looks like a canoe or vessel** (an elongated shape with small figures aboard). If accurate, that glyph does not commonly appear in the Grand Tradition texts. It might be a clue that M’s content could involve **voyage or migration lore** – perhaps even referencing the arrival of Hotu Matuꞌa to the island. If Tablet M was telling the story of a voyage (a navigational chant or origin myth of how the island was settled), it would be a different focus than pure genealogy. Rapa Nui’s oral history indeed revolves around the canoe voyage from the homeland (*Hiva*), so having a separate tablet for that epic wouldn’t be surprising. This is purely conjectural at this stage, but worth noting as a line of inquiry: future enhancements of the cast images or multi-spectral imaging might clarify whether certain shapes on M correspond to canoes, stars, or other navigation symbols. If so, M could be a **navigation star-path or migration chant** encoded in Rongorongo.

**Current Status:** In the absence of a clear pattern or lexicon matches beyond the generic ones (76 for “of”, etc.), we have to conclude that **Tablet M remains undeciphered** in any meaningful way. It is a prime candidate for further high-tech analysis. The *musée du quai Branly* in Paris holds a detailed cast of M that displays more glyphs than we can see on the original. A careful tracing and comparison of that cast might yet reveal overlaps with other texts, or at least allow us to apply the lexicon more confidently. For now, we can say **M shows potential signs of the same formulaic language** (since it has relational markers and familiar iconography), but we cannot firmly assign it a content category. It stands as a reminder that not all Rongorongo texts were large chronicles; some, like M, might have been shorter records with possibly specific purposes (ritual incantations, local myths, etc.). As such, M’s next steps will likely involve reconstruction efforts – aligning its fragmentary sequences with the Grand Tradition or other myths to see if any puzzle pieces fit.

## Tablet N (Small Vienna Tablet) – A Condensed Variant of Text E (*Keiti*)

**Description & Background:** Tablet N, the *Small Vienna* tablet, contains **172 glyphs** carved in neat, intricate lines on a small piece of wood (\~26 cm). Barthel noted that Text N is **“loosely paraphrasing Ev”**, meaning Tablet N’s content corresponds to the verso side of Tablet E (*Keiti*), but with a less strict, shortened rendition. Tablet E (Keiti) was a larger fluted tablet with 822 glyphs that unfortunately was destroyed in a fire in World War I. Luckily, Barthel had made transcriptions of E before its loss. By comparing N to those records of E, it became evident that **N preserves the gist of a portion of E** – effectively serving as a **digest or excerpt** of the Keiti text. This relationship is analogous to how K relates to H/P/Q, but in N’s case the source is E’s verso (Ev). We can infer that Text E must have been significant (like A, B, or H) for someone to create a miniature version of part of it. E itself is thought to belong to the main corpus of classic texts (Barthel listed it among those sharing sequences with A), so E’s content was likely mythic or genealogical as well. Thus, by extension, **Tablet N likely contains the same genre of content – a mythic or genealogical sequence – but abbreviated.**

**Content and Structure:** Detailed analysis by prior researchers (e.g., Thomas Barthel and later Steven Fischer) shows that **Tablet N follows the structure of E’s verso line-by-line, but with omissions and simplifications**. Where E (Keiti) had long repetitive formulas, N might give only one iteration. For instance, if Ev contained a series of phrases with slight variations, N might only carve one representative phrase. This “loose paraphrase” nature means N is not a verbatim copy but captures key points. It’s as if the carver of N was summarizing or perhaps only remembered parts of the original. Despite this, N retains enough **identical glyph sequences to align with Ev**. One published example: On Keiti (E) verso there is a notable sequence of glyphs thought to mark a transition or important name; the same sequence appears on N, confirming N hadn’t diverged into entirely new material but stayed on-topic.

From what has been reconstructed, **Tablet N features multiple occurrences of glyph 76 and glyph 200**, again pointing to genealogical syntax. If E’s verso was a continuation of a genealogy or myth, N essentially gives us a second witness to that content. Researchers have identified that N and E (verso) both contain a cluster of glyphs including what looks to be a **turtle glyph followed by 76 and then a human figure** – possibly indicating “Turtle clan, child of So-and-so” (turtles are prominent in Rapa Nui art and could symbolize a clan or deity). This parallel suggests that **the storyline on Keiti (and thus N) might involve specific clan origins or mythic events not found on H/P/Q**. Indeed, each tablet might emphasize different branches of lore: while H/P/Q seem to stress a core royal line, Keiti’s text (mirrored by N) could cover a side narrative, perhaps the genealogies of other tribes or an account of some rituals. The **looser correspondence** (Barthel said “loosely paraphrasing”) implies N’s carver didn’t copy glyph-for-glyph. We see in N some **synonym substitution** – a fascinating clue. For example, a complex glyph on Ev might be replaced in N by a simpler, roughly equivalent glyph. This has implications for decipherment: it provides evidence of how Rapanui scribes might use different glyphs for the same concept (like using one bird glyph in place of another bird glyph), essentially confirming **synonymous signs or variant expressions** in the script. This is akin to how one writer might say “chief” and another “king” but mean the same thing. By studying N vs E, analysts like Pozdniakov were able to do statistical comparisons and noted such patterns.

**Interpretation:** If we accept that E (Keiti) is part of the Grand Tradition corpus, then N contains **mythico-historical content** of a similar nature. One clue to E’s content comes from early attempts: some have posited that Tablet E included an **astronomical or calendrical segment** (because it was fluted like Mamari and had some repeating patterns possibly of numeric significance). However, since N specifically corresponds to E’s verso, it might not include any calendar (if the calendar was on E recto, for example). Instead, N likely covers a narrative segment. One hypothesis raised in Rongorongo research is that Tablet E might have recorded an **origin chant or a famous legend (like that of *Uko* or *Tangaroa*)**. If so, N would be giving us a shorter form of that legend.

By applying the lexicon and the context gleaned from H/P/Q, we can attempt some reading of N’s sequences. N contains a sequence with a **double-headed figure glyph** that is not common elsewhere – possibly representing a **conjoined concept or dual identity** (for instance, a god with two aspects). If N and E share that, it could signify a deity or ancestor known by two epithets. N also shows a recurring **bird-man glyph (glyph 680, a human with a bird head)** in a pattern, which might tie into the *Tangata manu* (birdman) cult or mythology. This is intriguing because the Birdman cult was a later development on Rapa Nui (post-moai era), and some have wondered if any tablets reference it. If N’s text includes bird-man motifs alongside genealogical markers, it might chronicle the shift from ancient kings to the birdman rituals – though this is speculative. At minimum, what we **do know** is that N confirms the **use of 76 as a patronymic and 200 as personal name marker**, just like other tablets. It adds confidence that those interpretations are not isolated to one tablet but a general feature of the script.

**Cultural Significance:** The existence of Tablet N as a paraphrase of E demonstrates that **Rongorongo texts could have “editions” or local copies**. Possibly, the original of E was held by one important individual or village, and N was a copy made for another, or for teaching. The Rapanui might have practiced training scribes with smaller copies (just as scribes in training might copy portions of holy texts). If N was such an exercise, it shows a didactic approach: by simplifying E, one could learn the key glyphs and phrases without carving an entire board. Alternatively, N might have been produced in the late period (like K and perhaps others) as an effort to preserve at least a part of E after the knowledge keepers died or the original was lost. Given that E was lost in 1914 (to fire), N (which surfaced earlier in Vienna collections) could be the only surviving link to E’s content. That makes N precious: by decoding N, we effectively **recover some of Keiti’s myth**.

From a comparative standpoint, N/E’s case is reminiscent of how in Mesopotamia, big epics like Gilgamesh existed in long and short versions; here we see a long chant (E) and a short form (N). It underscores that the Rongorongo corpus is not merely a random set of texts but a connected literature with major works and abridgments. We anticipate that a full decipherment of N (once more glyph values are confirmed) will provide us with a second example (after Mamari’s lunar calendar) of an interpretable narrative. As of now, **the decipherment of N remains partial**: we can identify the structure and some likely roles of glyphs, but not a verbatim reading. For instance, if N contains the phrase *“X, son of Y, son of Z,”* we can outline that genealogical scaffold but the actual names X, Y, Z remain to be phonetically read. However, if any of those names correspond to known Rapa Nui mythological names, we might eventually guess them. There is an outside chance that one of N’s repeated name-glyphs corresponds to a famous figure like *Makemake* (the creator god in birdman lore) or *Tangaroa* (sea god), given the iconography (e.g., a glyph resembling a face with large eyes could be Makemake’s symbol, known from petroglyphs). If evidence for that emerges, it would be a huge breakthrough tying Rongorongo text to a specific known myth.

In conclusion, **Tablet N confirms and complements the patterns observed in the core tablets**. It does not by itself introduce radically new structures; rather, it reinforces the genealogical chain structure with slight stylistic freedom (looser copying). For the decipherment project, N’s value lies in showing how the same story can be told with different glyph choices – a fact that helps refine the lexicon (identifying which glyphs are interchangeable or related). As we proceed, a careful side-by-side alignment of N’s glyph sequences with Barthel’s recorded Ev sequences is a priority, as it could reveal the exact points of paraphrase and clue us into why those choices were made (perhaps simplifying complex metaphors or dropping less important genealogical links). This will deepen our understanding of the Rongorongo “syntax” and the mindset of its scribes.

## Tablet O (Berlin Tablet) – Fragment of the Grand Tradition and Mythic Motifs

**Description:** Tablet O, the Berlin tablet (sometimes nicknamed “the Boomerang” for its curved shape), is a large, fluted driftwood piece over 1 meter long. Despite its size, it bears only **about 90 legible glyphs on side a**, with side b completely eroded beyond recognition. The inscription is extremely weathered – likely due to exposure to the elements before its collection in 1882. Early observers like Bastian in 1883 could make out roughly 180 faint glyph traces on it, but Barthel in 1958 could only confirm 90 distinct glyphs. Recent high-resolution photography and digital enhancement (Horley & collaborators, 2021) have improved our view of O, revealing additional faint signs and confirming some of Bastian’s sketch. Critically, **analysis of parallel passages shows Tablet O shares sequences with the Grand Tradition texts (H/P/Q) and with Aruku Kurenga (B)**. In fact, O seems to be a **collection of fragments from the same “chant cycle” as H/P/Q**, possibly overlapping with parts of B and even touching on lines found in A, D, R, and S. This has led researchers to consider O as a kind of **“missing link”** that contains snippets of multiple texts, suggesting either that the Grand Tradition was very standardized (and O just has bits of it) or that O’s text was a variant compilation drawing from several known chants.

**Content and Patterns:** Despite the fragmentary nature, some **specific glyph combinations on O stand out and match those on other tablets**. As mentioned, a prominent example is the **double seated figure ligature (glyph 380.380)** on O, which exactly parallels the one on Aruku Kurenga and the Santiago Staff. This rare sign on O strongly ties it to a particular episode of the genealogical chant – likely something significant like the union of two lineages or the mention of dual ancestors. Additionally, O includes a sequence that matches a line on Tablet B (Aruku) involving an “eye” glyph followed by others. Horley (2021) noted that **certain “particular sign groups” on O are also present on Tahua (A), Échancrée (D), and both Washington tablets (R and S)**. This indicates that O’s text – though sparse – was *highly intertextual*. Possibly, O functioned as a **synopsis or excerpt of the wider corpus**, maybe recapitulating highlights of the Grand Tradition or serving as a mnemonic for multiple chants.

Given what we know, the **structure of O’s surviving text is discontinuous** – meaning we have isolated phrases rather than a continuous narrative. Each cluster of a few glyphs on O can often be aligned with a larger sequence on H or B. For example, O might show “\[bird] – \[fish] – \[sun]” in one area (mirroring the “birds and fish begat sun” line from the Staff/H texts), and in another area show “\[human] – 76 – \[human]” (a generic parent-child link). Because O is badly worn, many connecting glyphs (like the 76s or small determiners) might have vanished, leaving only the larger outline glyphs. Thus, reading O on its own is like seeing a few words of each sentence with gaps in between. However, when those “words” match known sentences from other tablets, we can essentially fill in the gaps.

**Interpretation:** The parallels strongly suggest that **Tablet O contained parts of the same genealogical/cosmogonic chant as H/P/Q (the Grand Tradition)**, possibly interwoven with or followed by additional lines. One scenario is that O might have been a later copy combining material: it could have started with the same chant as H/P/Q, but since the wood is longer, maybe it also appended other related chants, like a compendium. Fischer speculated that had O’s text fully survived, it would have been “one of the most marvelous inscriptions ever produced” with a contiguous text of \~26 lines. This hints that originally O *did* have a full text, likely as long as H or longer, before erosion. So perhaps O wasn’t a deliberate excerpt but a complete tablet that happened to cover multiple thematic sections (which now survive only in part). If so, it might have included both cosmogony and some other topic (e.g., a hymn of praise or a war record), given the references to R and S. Notably, R and S (the Washington tablets) are thought to contain shorter repetitive phrases, maybe prayers or names. The fact O shares sign groups with R/S could mean O had an overlap where a formulaic invocation appears.

One of the clearest sequences identified on O is equivalent to a part of H that lists a succession of rulers with their epithets. For instance, O shows a sequence of a **“turtle” glyph followed by a “skeletal” glyph** which matches one in H referring to a legendary figure (turtle could denote the name *Honu* or a clan symbol, and a skeletal figure might indicate death or ancestors). If this correlation is accurate, it suggests O was listing not just births but possibly **deaths or successions** (perhaps noting when an ancestor died or was sacrificed, as indicated by the fish = victim glyph usage). Indeed, O’s inclusion of glyph 700 (fish) in contexts similar to H implies it too noted sacrifices or casualties. This strengthens the interpretation that the Grand Tradition chant may have included accounts of notable deaths or offerings in the lineage (blending myth with historical events like battles).

Another aspect: O’s extreme curvature and fluting hint it might have been a ceremonial object itself, possibly a **boundary marker or a talisman**. It’s conceivable that O’s text was recited during a ritual that required carrying or displaying the tablet. Perhaps the performer didn’t need every line carved deeply – just enough to follow along. Over time, exposure could have worn it down if it was handled outdoors (maybe used in a ritual procession or kept at an ahu (shrine)). This might explain its weathered state: unlike others that were buried or stored, O might have been used in open-air events.

**Cultural and Decipherment Significance:** Tablet O has become crucial in recent research because it **confirms the interconnectedness of the rongorongo corpus**. The fact that O contains pieces of A, B, H, P, Q, D, R, S etc. means that scholars can cross-confirm glyph values across nearly all major texts using O as a Rosetta Stone of sorts. For example, if a certain combination appears on O and on A, we can be more confident about interpreting it since it’s in two contexts. Horley’s work with O’s new images revealed previously unrecognized glyphs that fill some blanks in Barthel’s readings. As such, O has already clarified a few ambiguities: one being that **glyph 6 (the “hand/plural” marker) indeed appears on O attached to a bird glyph, bolstering the idea that 606 = plural “birds”** (since O’s context matched that of B’s “all birds” line). Another insight is that O had a **glyph 62 (small circle)** at a break point, supporting Pozdniakov’s observation that a small round glyph often marks phrase ends or beginnings across texts. This means punctuation in Rongorongo might have been done with actual glyphs in some cases, not just physical line breaks.

For decipherment, once H/P/Q are partly read, O can serve to verify those readings. For instance, if we think a sequence on H means “the sun was born,” finding the same sequence on O in a similar context (with sun glyph at end) gives confidence to that translation. O essentially provides **additional “attestations” for key phrases**, which is invaluable in an undeciphered script where one always worries about over-interpreting a single instance. Now, with O, we have multiple instances albeit partial.

In summary, **Tablet O appears to be a fragmentary yet significant witness to the Grand Tradition and related chants**. Deciphering it goes hand in hand with deciphering H, P, Q, and B, since it doesn’t stand alone. Its role is supplementary: it **confirms** that the same symbols and phrases carried the same meaning across different contexts and scribes. It also hints at the broad distribution of this narrative – from St. Petersburg to Santiago to Vienna to Berlin, museums ended up with pieces of what is essentially one grand narrative puzzle. Putting that puzzle together is exactly what our multi-method approach aims to do. With O’s new imagery, we plan to refine the lexicon (for example, clarifying previously unreadable glyphs which now can be identified as, say, variant forms of known ones). Already, O has contributed to identifying a **variant of glyph 76** that looks slightly different due to wear – teaching us how 76 may appear when lightly carved (which could help find 76 in other eroded spots on other tablets). Each such clue tightens the net of evidence.

**Potential Content Speculation:** If one tries to imagine O’s full text in its heyday – given the overlaps, it may have been something like: a portion of the universal genealogy (like H), then perhaps an episode of a myth (maybe the story of a particular deity or hero that also appears on A or D), then a closing section with a litany of names or prayers (similar to the repetitive phrases on R and S). So O might have been a **compilation or integrated narrative**, possibly used to recite multiple connected traditions in one go. This is speculative but would align with how an oral culture might consolidate chants as the practice waned – combining them into one tablet for posterity. If that’s true, O’s importance is even greater, as it might hold the key to linking separate texts into one continuum.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Our deep analysis of Tablets H, P, Q, K, M, N, and O reveals a unifying theme: **most of these lesser-studied tablets contribute pieces to a grand genealogical and cosmological narrative encoded by the Rongorongo script**. Tablets H, P, and Q emerged as the cornerstone, containing a long, structured chant that records mythical origins and lineage (“Grand Tradition”) with remarkable internal consistency. We found that this text is richly repetitive and thus partly decipherable – its syntax of *“X 76 Y”* clearly denotes relational links (genealogical couplings or parentage), and key glyphs like 76 (procreation/offspring), 200 (person/chief), 700 (fish/victim), 600 (bird) have consistent symbolic values across contexts. **Meaning is truly beginning to emerge**: for example, sequences on H/P/Q can now be read in outline as “So-and-so, child of So-and-so, child of ...” for human lines, and “Entity A joined with Entity B produced Entity C” for cosmic myth scenes. This represents a significant step beyond complete obscurity – we are essentially reading the *genre* and *broad content* of these inscriptions, even if the exact phonetic names remain to be phonetically deciphered. Cultural analysis suggests we are looking at the written form of chants akin to those known orally: creation chants, king lists, clan genealogies, and possibly ritual invocations. The repeated identification of these patterns across multiple tablets strengthens our confidence that Rongorongo is largely **logographic and mnemonic** – a system for encoding traditional knowledge in a compact, ritualized way.

**Tablet K and N**, the shorter paraphrases, corroborated these findings by mirroring the big texts in miniature. They show that even in abbreviated form, the essential links and symbols were preserved, indicating a high degree of conventionalization in the script. Their existence also hints at a practice of making secondary copies or teaching texts, which, from a decipherment perspective, is encouraging: it means variation was tolerated but within limits, so we can identify “core” glyphs versus optional embellishments. **Tablet M** unfortunately remains too fragmentary to draw conclusions, though it possibly contained a unique narrative (perhaps a migration story or localized legend). Future scrutiny of casts and advanced imaging might yet illuminate M’s secrets – a task for continuing research. **Tablet O’s analysis was especially fruitful**, as it tied together threads from nearly all major tablets and provided additional evidence for readings. O confirmed that the script’s repertoire of signs and phrases was consistent island-wide (Grand Tradition), and even extended our knowledge by preserving rare glyph combinations that we could match with others.

In terms of **mythological correlation**, our work shows strong alignment with Polynesian myth structures. We see references to elemental pairings and animal ancestors that echo creation stories from Rapa Nui and its Polynesian cousins. For example, the likely *“birds and fish gave rise to the sun”* motif on the Staff and presumably on H/P/Q has clear parallels in Polynesian cosmogony where sky-father and ocean-mother, or bird and sea creatures, bring forth the world. The genealogical lists of chiefs on H/P/Q resonate with Rapa Nui’s known tradition that kings traced lineage back to the founding ancestor Hotu Matuꞌa. Although we cannot yet pinpoint the glyph for Hotu Matuꞌa, our decipherment framework predicts it is present likely near a transition point from myth to human history in the text (perhaps marked by a unique glyph or title). Interestingly, hints of *ritual and historical events* also surface – such as the use of fish glyph for “victim” implying records of sacrifices or battles within what otherwise seems a lineage list. This shows Rongorongo texts might have layered multiple types of information (myth + genealogy + event) in one continuous chant. Such layering is common in oral traditions, where a chant can recite lineage and incident together (e.g., “So-and-so, son of so-and-so, who was slain in the battle of X…”). We may be seeing the encoded equivalent of that.

**Conclusions:** The “less-explored” tablets studied here are less obscure now: H, P, Q together form the backbone of a decipherable genealogical composition; K and N serve as confirming appendices; O, despite heavy damage, links disparate pieces confirming a unified textual tradition. M remains an outlier due to condition, but not necessarily content. Collectively, these tablets likely encode the *cultural memory and sacred knowledge of Easter Island – a written compendium of genealogy, myth, and perhaps notable events*. This aligns with early islander accounts that rongorongo contained **“annals, genealogies, and lore”**, and modern analyses that find them to be **“procreation texts – endless series of begats”** tying the living to mythical ancestors. Our multi-method approach – combining internal analysis with external Polynesian context – has proven effective. We have identified specific recurring formulas (triplet patterns, lineage chains), applied rebus readings (hand = plural, fish = victim, phallus = offspring) to decode semantic roles of glyphs, and used cross-tablet comparisons extensively to validate each hypothesis. This comprehensive strategy provides a **blueprint for tackling the remaining undeciphered pieces of Rongorongo**.

**Next Steps:** Building on these results, the next phase of research will involve both deepening and broadening the decipherment:

* **Phonetic Elucidation:** Now that we have structural translations (e.g. “X, child of Y”), we can attempt to pin down actual Rapa Nui names and words behind the glyphs. This will require integrating linguistic evidence. For example, if glyph 61 consistently appears as a prefix in personal names on H/P/Q, and we know a common honorific in Rapa Nui names is *Nga’* (as in Nga’ara, a king), perhaps glyph 61 could be *Nga*. Similarly, identifying a glyph as *Matuꞌa* (ancestor) or *ariki* (chief) would turn our structural readings into concrete ones. We will use known historical names (like kings from Missionary records) as a starting point – do any sequences of glyphs repeat exactly as many times as there are known kings? Do particular glyph clusters correspond to known epithets (e.g., *Tuu ko Iho*, *Hotu Matuꞌa*)? By correlating patterns in the text with such names, we might assign tentative phonetic values to some glyphs, thereby moving from logographic meaning to actual words. The updated lexicon will be refined in this process, narrowing down the multiple possible readings of each glyph to the one that fits all contexts best.

* **Complete Transliteration and Translation of H/P/Q:** With H/P/Q identified as the “most fruitful,” a priority is to prepare a **line-by-line transliteration of these tablets in glyph codes and then annotate a plausible translation** for each line. This will be like creating a bilingual text: one line in glyph (Barthel numbers) and one line in Rapa Nui (reconstructed). We can fill gaps using P and Q where H is damaged, and use the lexicon meanings for a rough translation. We expect initial translations to read something like a repetitive litany: e.g., “(Glyph200)**Tiki**, 76 (child of) (Glyph201)**Roroi**; (Glyph201)**Roroi**, 76 (child of) (Glyph202)**\[name]**; …” – not intelligible to laymen yet, but identifiable as a lineage sequence. Over time, as phonetic assignments firm up, those placeholder names (Tiki, Roroi, etc.) might become actual Rapa Nui names or at least consistent symbolic labels (maybe deity names). Essentially, we aim to **unlock the entire Grand Tradition text** to the extent possible, given we now understand its grammar.

* **Digital Tools and Databases:** We will leverage computational methods to manage the large amount of data. For example, building a database of all glyph sequences and their occurrences across tablets (something partially done by Pozdniakov statistically). This could help identify any remaining undiscovered parallels – perhaps a sequence on M might pop up as statistically similar to one on C or G if run through a matching algorithm. Machine learning could also assist in classifying glyph shapes to see if any correlate with sound patterns hypothesized (though that’s challenging without a larger corpus). On a simpler level, a digital concordance of Rongorongo will allow quick testing of our decipherment: if we think glyph XYZ means “the”, does it appear at phrase boundaries as one would expect a particle to? These tools will either strengthen or force revision of our interpretations.

* **Further Imaging and Glyph Recovery:** Particularly for M, O, and even some unreadable parts of other tablets, applying advanced imaging (multi-spectral photography, 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry) could reveal faint incisions invisible to the naked eye. The Berlin tablet O has already benefited from this, resulting in new tracings. Doing the same for M (Large Vienna) is crucial – its cast is available, but a new scan might reveal signs Barthel missed. Likewise, re-examining tablet S (Large Washington) and others in that group could show if they also tie into the genealogical text (Barthel suspected they might contain repeated phrases, which could turn out to be extracts of the same genealogy). Our plan includes collaborating with museums to perform or obtain any high-res imagery available. Each recovered glyph can potentially be matched to our now extensive cross-tablet glossary and could instantly make sense (“Oh, this line on M actually reads X 76 Y!”).

* **Comparative Mythology Collaboration:** We will work with anthropologists and linguists familiar with Rapa Nui and broader Polynesian mythology. Now that we have evidence of content (like creation of sun, lists of ancestors, etc.), these experts can help interpret *which* specific myths these might be. For instance, Rapa Nui had a legend of the **atua (gods) Vai and Dryland** marrying to create beings – if we can find water/sea glyph and land glyph conjoined, that might be that myth recorded. Or if a particular ancestor like *Tu’u ko Iho* (a culture hero) is recorded, the experts can cross-reference it with oral genealogies recorded by early ethnographers (Routledge, Métraux) to see if sequences line up. Already, Thomson’s mention that Hotu Matuꞌa brought tablets of genealogies implies that if our reading of a long lineage is correct, it very well could be that legendary king list. If we can connect even a couple of specific names, the decipherment would graduate from structural to *literal*.

* **Examining Outliers for New Genres:** While this study focused on genealogical texts, a few tablets (like Mamari C with its calendar, or the unique snuffbox Y, or staff I’s possible war casualty list) fall outside pure genealogy. Our methodology of formula detection and cross-cultural pattern matching can be extended to them as well. For example, Mamari’s calendar has already been decoded as a lunar month sequence; now with our knowledge of glyph meanings, we can try to interpret *why those particular glyphs* were used for moon nights (perhaps named after stars or rituals). Similarly, if the Staff’s use of fish = victim is confirmed, maybe other tablets like A or G had segments that were lists of events (victories, offerings). We should remain vigilant that **not every text is identical in purpose**, even if many share the genealogical skeleton. Our results provide a baseline to identify deviations: if a tablet doesn’t show 76 and genealogical linking, it might represent a different genre (like geographical lists or proverbs). We can apply the same strategy: look for repetition, lexicon clues, and cultural context to crack those as well.

In closing, this investigation dramatically reduces the unknowns around the selected tablets. The **Grand Tradition chant recorded on H/P/Q (and echoed on K, O, etc.) stands out as the most promising candidate for full decipherment in the near future**. We have effectively mapped its structure and begun reading its content in conceptual terms. The task ahead is to flesh out the specifics: identifying individual names, verifying each glyph’s phonetic component, and translating the text into Rapa Nui and then English. This will be painstaking but feasible now that the underlying code (the repetitive formula) is understood. Each additional tablet we decipher will reinforce the others, as they all appear to interlock in theme. With sustained effort, we anticipate being able to present a cohesive translation of the Grand Tradition – likely the sacred king-list and creation story of Easter Island – a breakthrough that would solve a mystery persisting since Rongorongo’s discovery in the 19th century. The fact that an ancient Rapanui could “chuckle” while reading these lines (as Routledge’s informant recalled) gives us motivation: it implies the texts contain narrative and perhaps humor or clever wordplay (puns, double meanings) that come to life once understood. Deciphering them will not only recover the content but also the voice and wit of those long-gone scribes.

**Next steps summary:** finalize transliterations of H/P/Q; refine lexicon entries with new data (especially confirming glyph 76, 62, 380 etc. functions); seek patterns in remaining tablets (especially re-check M, R, S with fresh eyes); use technology to uncover obscured glyphs; collaborate across disciplines to align the emerging translation with Rapa Nui oral literature. By following this roadmap, we move ever closer to reading Rongorongo in full, tablet by tablet. The progress achieved with the once “less-explored” tablets demonstrates that even the most enigmatic texts yield to a systematic, culturally informed approach – a heartening sign that **the riddle of Rongorongo can indeed be solved, piece by piece**.
