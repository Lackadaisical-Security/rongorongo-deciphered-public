# Phase 1: Rongorongo Sign Inventory & Initial

## ## Classification

### Overview of the Rongorongo Sign Inventory

The Rongorongo script of Easter Island consists of a catalog of 600+ distinct glyphs (629 entries in the
compiled lexicon) identified on the wooden tablets 1 2 . In this initial decipherment phase, we have
documented each unique sign along with its frequency, provisional meaning(s), and context of use, relying
strictly on internal evidence (patterns within the corpus) rather than external assumptions. Approximately
60-70 glyphs have been tentatively deciphered with specific meanings (often drawing on Polynesian
lexical parallels), while the majority remain un-deciphered or only broadly understood. Importantly, many
deciphered signs exhibit polysemy - they function as polysemic logographs carrying multiple related
meanings depending on context 3 . No clear signs of a purely phonetic (alphabetic or syllabic) system have
emerged in this phase; instead, the script appears to be largely logographic, with some signs also serving
grammatical or numeric functions. Special non-lexical symbols (e.g. section markers) have also been
identified.
Frequency Distribution: Glyph usage follows a skewed distribution. A handful of signs are very common
across the texts, while many others are rare. For example, the “person/human” glyph (ID 1) appears 127
times across multiple tablets 4 , making it one of the most frequent symbols. Likewise, the “hand/plural”
glyph (ID 6) occurs 156 times, reflecting its dual role as both a noun and a grammatical marker 5 . In
contrast, a large number of glyphs occur only once or twice in the corpus 6 7 - these often correspond
to specific names, rare objects, or have no decipherment yet. This frequency pattern suggests a core
vocabulary of common signs (likely function words, basic nouns, or repeatable phrases) and a long tail of
infrequent signs (possibly proper names, unique events, or unused variants). The script also shows
positional preferences: certain signs consistently occur in particular locations (e.g. at line beginnings or
ends, or in list-like sequences), hinting at structural or syntactic roles, which we detail below.
Classification Schema: Based on emergent internal patterns, each glyph has been assigned an initial
classification as one of the following types:
* Logographic - representing an entire word or concept (the predominant category).
* Syllabic - representing a syllabic sound value (none conclusively identified in Phase 1).
* Alphabetic - representing an individual phoneme (none identified).
* Compound - a composite glyph visually combining two or more other sign elements into one.
* Variant - a variant form of another base glyph (stylistic or contextual alternates).
* Structural/Unknown - non-lexical markers or glyphs of uncertain function (e.g. punctuation,
section markers, or glyphs with no decipherment).
Below we present the sign inventory organized by these categories. For each glyph we give its ID, English
meaning(s) or glosses, any Rapanui transliteration(s) proposed, the number of occurrences in the corpus, its
classification type, notes on positional/contextual usage, and key sources or attributions for its identification. All insights are drawn from Lackadaisical Security’s August Research unless otherwise
credited to external scholars (Barthel, Fischer, Guy, Pozdniakov, Knorozov, etc.), per the compiled research
logs.
Logographic Signs (Whole-Word/Ideographic Values)
Definition: These glyphs convey a full word or idea - typically a noun, verb, or descriptive concept. Many
logographs in Rongorongo correspond to concrete objects (people, body parts, animals, celestial bodies) or
actions, and often carry multiple related meanings that are disambiguated by context. The deciphered
logographs were identified by recognizing recurring sign sequences in thematic contexts (genealogies,
prayers, lists, etc.) and correlating them with Rapa Nui words or Polynesian concepts 8 . We emphasize
that these meanings emerged from internal pattern analysis (e.g. distribution in known context positions)
rather than being imposed a priori.
Characteristics:
* Logographs frequently appear in relevant semantic contexts. For example, the human figure glyph is
prevalent in genealogical name lists and phrases about people 9 , and the fish glyph is common in
sequences related to food offerings or mythic tales of the sea 10 .
* Many have polysemic uses: a single sign can mean one thing in one context and a related concept in
another. A notable case is the fish glyph (ID 700) which means “fish” in ordinary contexts but also signifies
“victim” or “sacrificial offering” in ritual contexts 10 . Such dual meanings likely arise from rebus or metaphor
(in Rapa Nui, the word for “fish” ika is metaphorically used for “victim”) 11 .
* Logographs account for most of the high-frequency signs, indicating they form the core lexicon of the
script. They often combine with other glyphs to form composite phrases, but the individual logographic
value can usually be inferred when they appear in isolation.
Examples: The table below lists the major logographic glyphs deciphered so far, with their meanings and
usage details. These include glyphs for people, body parts, natural elements, animals, and important
cultural concepts. (Many of these identifications align with earlier hypotheses by Barthel and others, as
noted in the sources, though confirmed here through independent analysis of the texts.)

Notes:LS August Research = Lackadaisical Security (The Operator) - August 2025 internal research logs.
(**) Some glyphs listed here (e.g. IDs 36, 37) are technically variant forms of a base logograph but are given
separate entries due to distinct usage; they are marked as variants in the Classification column but still
carry logographic meanings.
As shown above, the logographic signs cover key semantic domains: humans and kinship (1, 7), body
parts and actions (2-6), natural elements (water 40, fire 8, rain 39, moon phases 45-46), fauna (fish 700,
shark 710, birds 37 & 44, turtle 68 - see variants below), and culturally significant symbols (frigatebird/
dance 44, etc.). This breadth underscores that Rongorongo’s script encodes a wide range of content from
genealogy and mythology to environment and ritual life. The deciphered meanings have been crossvalidated where possible with known Rapa Nui words and cultural knowledge, but importantly, they arise
from pattern analysis within the texts themselves (for instance, the fish/victim dual reading was
deduced from the glyph’s repeated occurrence in sacrificial lists vs. food lists 10 11 , not just assumed from
outside lore).
Syllabic Signs
No clear syllabic glyphs (signs representing a syllable of spoken language) have been identified in this
phase. Our analysis has not found any symbol that consistently corresponds to a CV (consonant-vowel) unit
or similar phonetic syllable across different contexts. Unlike some other scripts, Rongorongo shows no
unambiguous syllabograms in its inventory at this point. Every frequently occurring glyph carries an
identifiable semantic value (e.g. “bird”, “water”, “person”) rather than a purely phonetic one. It is possible
that Rongorongo could employ some phonetic complements or rebus-like uses, but if so, those signs also double as logographs for whole words. For example, a glyph might be used rebus-wise for its sound in rare
cases, but we have not confirmed any stand-alone phonetic usage yet.
Conclusion:No syllabic classification is assigned to any glyph in the current inventory. The script appears
to be predominantly logographic in nature at this stage of decipherment 8 , with no discrete syllable signs
isolated.
Alphabetic Signs
Similarly, no alphabetic (single-phoneme) signs have been identified. We did not find any glyph that
represents a lone consonant or vowel sound independent of meaning. The Rongorongo script does not
show an alphabetic character set like a typical Western alphabet. Every sign carries at least a chunk of
meaning, not an abstract sound. There are also no obvious patterns of an acrophonic alphabet or similar.
The analysis so far suggests Rongorongo is not an alphabetic script - none of its characters correspond
to invariant single sounds (like “a” or “t”).
Even the smallest marks in the script (such as short strokes or dots) appear to function as part of composite
signs or as punctuation, rather than as letters. Therefore, no glyphs are classified as alphabetic at this
time.
Compound Signs (Composite Glyphs)
Definition: Compound signs are those that are visually or functionally composed of multiple basic
glyph elements merged into one symbol. These often represent a concept that is a combination of the
components’ meanings. In Rongorongo, truly compound glyphs are relatively rare - most glyphs are atomic
units. However, we have identified a few cases where a single sign seems to fuse two others:
* The most notable is the “Bird-Man” glyph (ID 690), which combines a human figure with bird-like
features 57 . This compound glyph represents the Tangata Manu or “bird-man”, a central figure in
Rapa Nui ritual (the annual bird-man competition of Orongo) 58 . Visually, this sign appears as a
hybrid: a human body or head with bird elements (beak or wings). Its occurrence is limited (12 times,
primarily on the Santiago Staff) but contextually it always relates to ceremonial or mythic content 59
60 . The Bird-Man glyph is an example of a compound ideogram encoding a specific culturally
significant idea by blending two symbols (“bird” + “man”).
* Another possible compound usage is the attachment of the “hand” glyph to other glyphs to
indicate plurality (as discussed above for glyph 6). In practice, the plural marker is often written as a
smaller hand shape adjoining a noun glyph, almost like a diacritic. While graphically adjacent, this is
more of a grammatical ligature than a fused pictogram - we still treat it as two signs in sequence
(noun + plural). So, it is a morphographic compound but not a single unified glyph shape. We note
it here because it visually combines with others, but in the inventory table it remains listed as glyph 6
(Logographic).
* We have not encountered other definitive compound glyphs in this phase. Many glyphs that appear
complex (with multiple parts) were initially thought to be composites, but further analysis showed
them to be single entities or variant forms rather than deliberate fusions of separate signs. For instance, a “composite glyph combining 600 (bird) and 6 (hand)” was considered to represent “group
of birds” (plural birds) 61 , but this is now understood as the sequence of a bird glyph followed by
the plural hand, not a new fused glyph.
The table below details the confirmed compound glyph(s):

(No other fully compound glyphs have been confirmed in Phase 1. Most multi-part signs are handled as base
glyph + affix or as variants.)
Variant Glyphs (Stylistic/Orthographic Variations)
Definition: Variant glyphs are alternate forms of a base sign, differing in shape or orientation but
conveying a similar meaning. These may reflect stylistic differences by carvers, contextual variants (e.g. a
simplified form in certain texts), or slight semantic distinctions (such as gender or species variants of an
animal glyph). We have identified a number of variants through internal comparison - often a variant
occurs in place of a more common form in a specific context, hinting at its equivalence or specialized usage.
Examples of Variants:
* Evening Star (glyph 36) - as noted, this is essentially the star glyph used for Venus in its evening
appearance. It is considered a variant of the main star sign 38 , distinguished perhaps by an added mark or
differing orientation, but functionally it denotes the same entity (Venus) at a different time of day.
* Small Bird (glyph 37) - a variant of the generic bird sign (commonly in the 600-series) with modified
proportions (shorter wings). Its usage for a land bird or small bird suggests it is a contextual or
taxonomic variant of the frigatebird symbol 39 . The base concept “bird” remains, but the variant
specifies a different kind of bird.
* Sea Turtle Variant (glyph 41) - this glyph is a side-profile turtle which differs from the standard
turtle glyph (ID 68) that appears in other contexts. Glyph 41 occurs only twice and “is not used in
the night count”, implying it might mark a different concept (possibly daytime) or a gender/species
variation of turtle 64 . Notes explicitly call it “a variant turtle glyph (side-view) also meaning ‘honu’ (sea
turtle)”, likely indicating male vs. female turtle or a symbolic vs. literal usage 64 65 . In any case, it’s
treated as a variant form of the turtle sign with the same basic meaning “turtle,” not a wholly new
logograph.
* Octopus Alternate (glyph 42) - an alternate depiction of an octopus or squid, with emphasis on
multiple arms 66 . The main octopus sign is elsewhere in the inventory (glyph 800 in Barthel’s
system), and glyph 42 appears to be a smaller or stylistically different form (“tentacles” focused). It
likely supports or repeats the meaning of the main octopus glyph in contexts where space or style
calls for a simplified form. This variant reinforces the reading of glyph 800 by appearing in related
contexts.
* Shark Alternate (glyph 43) - a possible variant of the shark glyph, interpreted as perhaps a
hammerhead shark (“makoi” or “mango”) 67 . It has only one attestation. Its shape deviates from the
regular shark sign (710) enough to suggest it’s a specific kind of shark. We classify it as a variant
because it shares semantic field (sharks/fish) with the main shark sign, though if future evidence
shows it consistently means a distinct concept (hammerhead vs common shark), it could be
considered a separate logograph. For now, it’s an animal variant with a tentative meaning.

(Note: Glyph 211 and similar are essentially “empty” signs with no content meaning - they are described in the
next section. They are included in variant category only insofar as they might be variant forms of a generic divider
or erasure mark.)
In summary, variant signs do not introduce new vocabulary to the script; rather, they reflect how certain
concepts could be drawn in more than one way. Understanding these variants is important for
transliteration and reading, as one must recognize that e.g. the side-view turtle and top-view turtle are the
same word in different form. Our internal evidence approach flagged these by noting their complementary
distribution with base forms and identical or very close notes in the research log (often explicitly labeled
"variant" 64 ). We mark ambiguous cases as variants pending further proof. As decipherment progresses,
some variant attributions might be revised, but at this foundational stage we err on the side of linking
uncommon forms to their likely base glyphs rather than proliferating new logographs without clear need.
Structural and Positional Markers (Non-Lexical Glyphs)
In addition to content-bearing glyphs, Rongorongo features non-lexical symbols that serve structural or
formatting functions in the text. These do not represent spoken words or morphemes of the Rapa Nui language; instead, they act as punctuation, section dividers, or scribal notations. We have identified the
following:
* Section Divider “Paragraph Break” (glyph 999) - A vertical stroke glyph used as a punctuationlike divider. This sign appears over 100 times on the Santiago Staff, regularly separating segments
of text 70 . It has no phonetic value and is not read aloud - it simply marks a break between verses,
lines, or list items (analogous to a period or comma in a written text) 71 72 . The research notes
describe it as “Non-lexical structural marker: 'section divider'… Punctuation-like vertical stroke dividing
verses” 71 . Its high frequency (103 occurrences) and systematic use confirm it as a confirmed
structural punctuation sign 73 74 . This is a crucial discovery, as it demonstrates that Rongorongo
text was organized into coherent units (perhaps lines of chant or genealogy) separated by this glyph.
(Notably, Barthel did not originally assign a number to this in his catalog; we assign ID 999 for
reference in our project data.)
* Line-Start or Correction Marks (glyphs 211, 263, 326, etc.) - A few glyphs have no deciphered
reading but occur exactly twice each and are noted as “structural marker or referenced in
corrections” 6 7 . These include glyph 211, 263, 326 (and possibly others at regular intervals). They
do not form words and seem to appear in margin positions or in situations where a correction or
deletion is made. We suspect these are scribal marks, perhaps used to indicate where a section
starts, ends, or an error was made (like an editorial mark). For instance, glyph 211 is explicitly noted
with “No decipherment - this glyph appears as structural marker or in corrections.” 6 . The pattern of
their IDs suggests Barthel’s catalog might have reserved or noted these as well (they appear roughly
at one per 50-60 glyphs, possibly placeholders). In our classification, we mark them as structural/
unknown. They are effectively variants of a generic idea “not part of text proper.” They could be
analogous to paragraph indent marks or erasure marks. Further study of tablet imagery would be
needed to confirm their exact visual form and function. For now, we simply record them as nonlexical.
* Numerical or Calendrical Marks: Some logographic signs doubled as numerical or temporal
markers (e.g. the water glyph 40 used as a night counter as noted). These are still content signs, but
we mention them here because they function structurally in sequences (like repeating 30 times to
count nights). They are not separate symbols, just an application of logographs in a structural way.
So no distinct numeric glyph set has been isolated - the script likely used existing signs in repetitive
patterns to convey numbers or ordered lists (as with the lunar calendar).
The table below summarizes the clear structural markers:

Interpretation: The presence of glyph 999 (divider) confirms that the Rongorongo script utilized
punctuation to organize information 71 . This is an emergent pattern from internal evidence: the consistent
placement and high count of this glyph on one artifact could only mean a non-verbal function, which our
analysis corroborated by noting the evenly spaced occurrences and lack of associated text for it. Likewise,
the low-frequency structural marks (211, etc.) show that not every carved glyph is a “word” - some are
metadata or editing marks. These findings underscore the importance of not forcing a reading onto every
sign; some truly have no spoken value and should be treated as functional symbols.
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that no dedicated “line filler” glyph (often a feature of some scripts to pad
out line-ends) has been conclusively identified, though the structural markers above might have served a
similar role.
Conclusion (Phase 1 Outcomes)
In summary, Phase 1 has produced a comprehensive sign inventory and initial classification for the
Rongorongo script. We have catalogued each glyph with its frequency and context, distinguishing between
logographic signs (the majority, carrying meaning), a few compound signs (rare hybrid symbols), variant
forms of certain glyphs, and non-lexical structural markers. We refrained from assigning any alphabetic or
syllabic status to signs due to lack of evidence - the internal patterns strongly indicate a primarily
logographic system 8 with contextual polyvalence. Major trends include the high frequency of humanrelated and grammar-related signs (indicating the script often discusses people and uses grammatical
plurality), the presence of polysemic signs that play on double meanings (fish/victim, frigatebird/dance), and
the use of spacing or divider glyphs to structure texts.
This inventory provides a foundation for the next phases of decipherment. With the basic identities of signs
and their tentative meanings in hand, we can move on to Phase 2 (massive correlational analysis with other
scripts) and Phase 3 (semantic clustering) with confidence that our sign list is robust and internally
consistent 78 . All classifications here are not forced but rather assigned with a confidence level;
ambiguous cases remain marked as “Unknown” or “Variant” as appropriate. As decipherment progresses,
some glyphs’ classifications may be revised (for instance, if evidence of phonetic use for a sign emerges in
Phase 2, it could be reclassified). For now, however, the script appears to be logo-syllabic leaning heavily
to logographic, without a standalone phonetic grid, and its structure relies on the intelligent placement of
meaningful signs and occasional punctuation.
