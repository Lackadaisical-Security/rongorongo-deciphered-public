# Deciphering the Aruku Kurenga (Tablet B) with a Multi-Method Approach

## Recurring Sequences and Structural Patterns in Tablet B

Aruku Kurenga (Text B) exhibits **highly structured, repeated sequences** of glyphs. Notably, Russian epigraphers Butinov and Knorozov observed that **three lengthy sequences repeat in parallel** on this tablet – essentially the *same text rendered in three variants*. Each sequence is composed of roughly 11–14 glyph groups, and they appear to recount the **same series of events or list** with minor variations. In other words, Tablet B contains a **tripartite textual structure**: three passages with nearly identical patterns (differing only by a few glyphs). This suggests the tablet encodes a **formulaic or poetic narrative** repeated multiple times, much like verses of a chant or stanzas of a song.

To clarify this pattern, scholars label the three sequences as Series A, B, and C. A comparative breakdown is given in the table below:

| **Expedition Series**   | **Leading Glyph (Role)**                                 | **Number of Place-Name Groups** | **Distinct Additions**                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A (First sequence)**  | Glyph `A` (constant, likely **Hau-Maka** figure)         | \~11 groups (base sequence)     | *(None – base sequence of events)*                                                                               |
| **B (Second sequence)** | Glyph `B` (constant, likely **“the scouts”** as a group) | \~11 groups (same places as A)  | 2 extra glyphs: inserted at positions 9 and 11 (denoted B9a, B11a) – perhaps additional details in this variant. |
| **C (Third sequence)**  | Glyph `C` (constant, likely **Hotu Matua** figure)       | \~11 groups (same places as A)  | 3 extra glyphs: at positions 8, 9, and 11 (C8a, C9a, C11a) – added detail unique to the final rendition.         |

Each sequence thus shares the **same ordered set of “variable” glyphs (x)** – which correspond to specific place or event names – while prefacing them with a **sequence-specific leader glyph** (A, B, or C). The leader glyphs are believed to represent the **protagonists of each sequence**: A = Hau-Maka, B = the scouts, and C = Hotu Matuꞌa. The repetition of the same ordered places/events under different leaders is a strong structural clue that the text is recounting a story in **three parallel phases**.

Critically, this repeating pattern aligns with a known Rapa Nui **mythological narrative** (discussed more below): first the priest Hau-Maka’s discovery of the land, then the **expedition of scouts**, and finally the arrival of King Hotu Matuꞌa, each following the same route. The fact that Aruku Kurenga’s glyph sequences occur in triplicate strongly suggests a deliberate **segmental structure** – likely reflecting *verses in an oral chant or three iterations of a tale*. Such repetition would have aided memorization and ritual recitation.

Beyond the large-scale tripartite division, **smaller recurring glyph clusters** are also evident. For example, certain **glyph bigrams and trigrams repeat within and across lines**, hinting at stock phrases or grammatical constructions. Early analyses noted that some sequences on Tablet B closely resemble those on other tablets. Thomas Barthel found that **sections of Text A (Tahua) reappear on Text B (Aruku)** (as well as on C, E, H, P, Q), though scattered in different order. This implies that **formulaic phrases or refrains** were shared across tablets, possibly standard invocations, genealogical references, or proverbs that multiple scribes inscribed in various contexts. Recent computer comparisons confirm that Aruku Kurenga shares distinctive glyph strings with the so-called “Great Tradition” texts – e.g. the Large and Small St. Petersburg tablets and the Large Santiago tablet. In summary, **parallel passages** show that Tablet B is not an isolated composition but part of a broader corpus of interrelated texts, with **reusable textual building blocks**.

Another notable pattern on Aruku Kurenga is the **delineation of segments by specific glyphs**. For instance, one analysis observes that a particular sign (Barthel’s glyph 32) appears to **mark the boundary** between a preceding structured sequence and the start of the repeated series on Tablet B. Such glyphs may function like punctuation or section dividers. Likewise, the **radial “Sun/Star” glyph (№ 8)** frequently occurs at the **beginning of lines or sequences**, on this and other tablets. Glyph 8 (called *ra’a* “sun” or *hetu‘u* “star”) often heads a segment, possibly as a **celestial or temporal marker**. Its recurring placement suggests it might announce a new stanza, day, or important event – akin to a capital letter or a ceremonial opener in the text.

In sum, Aruku Kurenga’s content is **highly structured**. Its threefold repetition of near-identical glyph series is a clear structural motif, pointing to intentional patterning (likely reflecting an important legend told in a cyclic or emphatic manner). Recognizing these recurring sequences was a key step in modern analysis: identifying shared phrasing and repetition “was one of the first steps in unraveling the structure of the script”. It allows researchers to isolate potential **ligatures** (combined glyphs) and allographs (variant forms) by comparing repeats across contexts. In fact, by aligning the repeating sequences of Tablet B, one can spot where a glyph is written in a slightly different form in one sequence versus another – revealing it as the *same sign* (allograph) modified or fused with a neighbor in one case. For example, if Sequence A and B share a cluster but in B two signs are merged as one, analysts can deduce how those glyphs combine. In this way, recurring sequences on Aruku Kurenga have helped decipher the script’s inventory and rules (much as parallel texts helped reveal ligature behavior elsewhere).

## Phonetic–Rebus Interpretations and Symbolic Readings

Given the repeating patterns and identifiable structures, researchers have applied **phonetic-rebus analysis** to interpret Aruku Kurenga’s glyphs. This approach leverages the provided Rongorongo lexicon of glyph values and **Polynesian linguistic parallels** to assign sounds or meanings to signs, often by **iconography or pun**. In essence, scholars ask: *What could this glyph depict, and does that image correspond to a Rapanui word that fits the context?* The results are hypothetical but illuminating. Below are several glyphs from Aruku Kurenga (and related texts) with their proposed phonetic or symbolic interpretations:

* **Glyph 200** – *Anthropomorphic figure (chief/person)*: Often appears as a standalone human figure. In repeated sequences (e.g. on the Small Santiago tablet line Gv5–6), glyph 200 recurs in a pattern consistent with a title or personal name marker. Butinov and Knorozov famously posited it stands for **“ariki”** (chief/king) or a personal name, repeated in genealogical lists. On Tablet B, the analogous leading figures A, B, C might be specific persons (Hau-Maka, etc.), essentially fulfilling a similar role of a **proper name or title** at the head of each segment.

* **Glyph 76** – *Phallus motif*: In the lexicon this sign is associated with *“ai”* (to copulate) or *“fanau”* (to procreate). On the Santiago Staff and other texts, glyph 76 attaches to person-glyphs in repetitive sequences. The leading hypothesis is that **76 functions as a patronymic marker**, effectively meaning “offspring of” or “begotten by”. This interpretation arises from a genealogical reading: e.g. a sequence like **200  …  76** might read “Chief So-and-so, son of …”. The logic is symbolic – a phallic sign denoting procreation (and thus descent). In Fischer’s earlier literal attempt, sequences such as *606.76 700* were read as bawdy mythology (“all the birds copulated with the fish”). Under the patronymic interpretation, that same glyph string would instead mean **“So-and-so, child of \[bird], was slain”**, treating 76 as “child of” and glyph 700 (fish) as “victim”. This example highlights how a glyph’s **iconic meaning (“to copulate”) can be extended via rebus** to a grammatical function (“produced/born of”) in lineage contexts.

* **Glyph 700** – *Fish shape*: Metoro Tau’a Ure, Bishop Jaussen’s Rapanui informant, identified a fish-like glyph as *ika* “fish”. But researchers noted that in Rapa Nui, **ika** also means **“victim” or “war casualty”** by metaphor (as in *ko hau ika*, the “fish” lists of slain warriors). Indeed, Knorozov proposed glyph 700 is used as a **rebus**: pictographically “fish” but semantically “victim.” On the Santiago Staff, which may record a **kohau ika** (war casualty list), glyph 700 occurs 63 times, consistent with listing deaths. On Aruku Kurenga, the fish glyph might appear in mythic contexts (perhaps referring to actual fish or symbolic offerings), but if the tablet includes any account of deaths or sacrifices, 700 could similarly mark those. The lexicon confirms multiple shades: *ika* “fish”, *kai* (a word for consumption or victim), and *haka ira* “sacrifice” are all associated with glyph 700.

* **Glyph 600** – *Bird figure*: This is a common glyph depicting a bird (often a frigatebird or generic bird-man figure). It is read as **“manu”** (“bird”) and appears frequently in creation chants and myth lists (the bird has strong cultural significance on Rapa Nui). When glyph 600 is combined or doubled, interesting things happen. For instance, **glyph 606** (as listed by Barthel) is literally a composite of *600 + 6*, i.e. a bird with an extra “hand” element attached. In Rapanui, *rima* (hand/five) was sometimes used as a plural marker. Indeed, Fischer interprets glyph 606 as **“birds (plural)”** – essentially a pluralized *manu* meaning “flock” or “many birds”. This is supported by the observation that 606 appears when a plurality is implied (e.g. “all the birds…” in Fischer’s reading). Thus, **adding glyph 6 (hand) serves a grammatical role of pluralization** – a beautiful example of a rebus-based affix: a hand (rima) suggesting *rima* (five, many) or the act of grasping a group. On Aruku Kurenga, if a passage refers collectively to beings (birds, people, etc.), we might expect such composite plural signs. (Notably, the Staff’s hypothetical reading “all the birds’ offspring…” involves 606 for “all birds”.)

* **Glyph 8** – *Sun or star*: A radial, spoked glyph identified as *raꞌa* “sun” or *hetu‘u* “star”. While often considered a **celestial symbol**, in phonetic terms *ra‘a* could also pun with *rangi* (sky) or other cosmological concepts. On Aruku Kurenga, one of the repeating sequences might start with this glyph, invoking the sky or daybreak. Interestingly, in trying to match glyphs to place names, one proposal read a certain occurrence of glyph 8 not literally as “sun” but as part of a place name: **Taharoa** – a toponym containing *taha* (a seabird). Here the analysts treated glyph 8’s shape as perhaps resembling a bird or star and linked it via Polynesian homophone: *tava* or *tavake* (tropic bird). Indeed, they suggest glyph 8 in one sequence could correspond to **Hanga Te Tavake** (Bay of the Frigatebird). This shows how flexible rebus interpretation can be – the *same glyph* could mean “sun” in one context and stand for a syllable or word in a place name in another, if the visual fits.

* **Glyph 9** – *Geometric form (perhaps Earth or sand)*: Metoro read one frequently occurring glyph as **“one (o)ne”** meaning *sand or sandy ground*. In the expedition story, the scouts search for a **“sandy beach”** to settle. Indeed, the legend specifies they sought out Anakena, the only sand beach on the island. The **ninth place name glyph** in the Aruku sequence was interpreted by Metoro as “sand,” likely pointing to **Anakena or its vicinity**. Researchers have narrowed this to either **Taharoa** (the sandy dunes near Anakena) or **Hanga-o-Honu** (a bay by a sandbank). In other words, glyph 9 appears to be used as a *toponymic rebus*: picturing granular soil to denote a known sandy location. This is a good example of **iconographic clues combined with oral tradition** – because the context of the myth gives us a hint that a “sand” glyph should show up when the scouts reach the beach.

* **Glyph 7** – *Small human figure (perhaps a child)*: According to Metoro, one glyph in the sequence was read aloud as **“poki”** – meaning *child, offspring, or descendant*. This was perplexing, since the context in the route list was a place name, not literally a person. It turns out *Vai Mahiki* (a spring on Poike) is named from **Mahaki**, a term used in legends to refer to an absent person or substitute for a relative. Scholars hypothesize that the **7th glyph in the route** (which Metoro thought meant “child”) might actually stand for **Mahaki**, given its position corresponds to Poike peninsula. Perhaps the glyph depicted a small human figure (child) and was initially understood generically as “offspring,” but in this context it labels a place associated with *Mahaki*. This illustrates how **one glyph can carry multiple layers** – a literal idea (“child”) and a specific name (Mahaki) that only makes sense if one knows the story. It underscores the rebus principle: the glyph’s meaning is *figurative*, guided by context.

* **Glyph 11** – *Bird or bird-related symbol*: In one of Aruku’s sequences, a glyph appears that researchers think denotes a **bird**. This is because the final destination, Anakena, translates as “cave of birds.” If the text marks the end of each expedition with a place glyph for Anakena, one expects some avian reference. The **11th glyph** (end of the route) may indeed be a pictograph of a bird, used to signify Anakena’s name. Supporting this, a variant of glyph 11 on other tablets is associated with *manu* (bird) or specifically frigatebirds. Thus, a bird glyph at group 11 would elegantly close the sequence in reference to Anakena’s etymology. This again is a likely **pivotal glyph** where the scribe recorded only a clue (“bird”) and the knowledgeable chanter would supply “Anakena” from memory.

These examples demonstrate the **phonetic-rebus method** in action. The Rongorongo signs were not a straightforward alphabet; instead, the scribe often chose a glyph for its **semantic value or visual pun**. By matching glyph shapes to Rapa Nui words (names, verbs, nouns) that fit the mythic context, researchers piece together plausible readings. It appears Tablet B’s inscription emphasizes **key content words (“pivots”)** – e.g. the name of a place, an action like “to go,” or a title like “chief” – rather than writing out every syllable. This aligns with islander testimonies that **rongorongo texts contain only the main words** of chants, relying on the reader’s memory to fill in the narrative. For instance, Metoro’s partial “reading” of Aruku Kurenga often involved saying a known name or term when he saw a glyph, even if the glyph itself only hinted at it. In one case, he uttered **“Kuukuu”** (name of a famous scout) when no explicit “Kuukuu” glyph was present – perhaps triggered by seeing a *tomb* glyph (avanga) that in the story would refer to Kuukuu’s burial. This suggests that the rongorongo expert (*tangata rongorongo*) recognized glyphs as cues for reciting the full story by heart.

Thus, in deciphering Aruku Kurenga, scholars combine the lexicon’s insights (possible values of each sign) with rebus logic and Rapa Nui linguistics. **Phonetic interpretations** (like reading glyph 76 as syllable *ai* or glyph 6 as plural *rima*) are tested against **symbolic interpretations** (like seeing glyph 76 as a generic “offspring” marker or glyph 6 as a hand indicating plurality). The provided translator dataset, which lists candidate meanings and Polynesian cognates for each glyph, is invaluable for this cross-referencing. We validate hypotheses by checking if the sequence of proposed meanings forms a coherent segment of Rapa Nui myth or phrase. In many cases, as shown above, the **glyph clusters do map onto known mythological elements** – strongly suggesting the interpretation is on the right track.

## Mapping Glyph Clusters to Rapa Nui Mythology and Oral Traditions

The structured sequences in Aruku Kurenga become far more meaningful when aligned with **Rapa Nui mythology, chants, and genealogical lore**. Tablet B’s three repeating sequences correspond strikingly to the **legend of Easter Island’s discovery and settlement**. In oral tradition, there were *three* critical voyages to Te Pito O Te Henua (Easter Island): first, the vision of **Hau-Maka** (whose spirit traveled in a dream or exploratory astral journey to find the new land); second, the voyage of **a party of scouts** (sent by King Hotu Matuꞌa to physically explore and report back); and third, **Hotu Matuꞌa’s own migration** with his people to settle the island. Crucially, all expeditions follow the **same path** around the island and culminate at **Anakena beach** – the desired landing spot with its sandy shore.

Aruku Kurenga appears to encode *exactly this narrative*. The three series (A, B, C) on the tablet likely correspond to the **three expeditions** in the myth. As noted, each series begins with a distinct glyph presumed to identify the leader: glyph A for Hau-Maka, glyph B for the group of scouts, glyph C for Hotu Matuꞌa. Following each leader, the sequences list a chain of place-name glyphs – these are the *x(1), x(2), x(3)...* groups discussed earlier, which are common to all three series. In the legend, Hau-Maka’s spirit and later the scouts traversed a **series of landmarks** along the coast (often enumerated as about 50 named places) before finding the “promised land” at Anakena. Indeed, the structural analysis of Tablet B found on average 11–14 glyph groups per series, which aligns with a **condensed list of major stops** rather than all 50 minor ones – perhaps the tablet records only the key points.

Detailed comparison shows convincing alignments between glyphs and known place names from the **Hau-Maka / Hotu Matuꞌa saga**. For example:

* The journey starts at **Orongo** (the sacred village by the western sea and the small islets). Early glyphs likely correspond to the motu islets and points of land as Hau-Maka “proceeded along the islets Motu Nui, Motu Iti and Motu Kaokao to the east” in his dream. However, reading the first 5–6 place glyphs has proven difficult, possibly because they might be obscure or abbreviated references to those islets and cliffs, which we cannot easily identify without more of Metoro’s input.

* As the path continues along the **southern coast** toward Poike (the eastern peninsula), one glyph in each sequence (the 7th group) was read as *poki* (child/descendant) by Metoro. Researchers hypothesize this refers to **Vai Mahaki** on Poike. In the legend, *Mahaki* is a term for a substitute or “descendant” used when someone is absent, and it appears in context of Poike. Thus, **glyph 7** in the sequence possibly encodes *Mahaki* (using the “child” symbol as a pun) – marking the Poike segment of the journey.

* Later in the sequence, as each expedition rounds Poike and heads north, the names **Taharoa** and **Hanga o Honu** appear in oral versions. These are sandy areas before Anakena. Correspondingly, Aruku’s sequence contains **glyph 9 “sand”** at group 9. Metoro’s translation of that glyph as *one one* (sand) strongly suggests it denotes the sandy stretch of **Taharoa** (literally “great sandbank”) or the neighboring cove Hanga-o-Honu. In either case, it’s a clear marker of the final approach to Anakena. The presence of a “sand” glyph exactly where the story involves searching for *sandy land* is a compelling alignment of text and myth.

* The final destination **Anakena** (“cave of birds”) likely corresponds to the **glyph 11 “bird”** in group 11. Each series probably ends with this bird glyph, signaling that the expedition ended at Anakena. The consistency of a bird-symbol at the end of all three sequences reinforces that interpretation – it’s the common terminus for Hau-Maka, the scouts, and Hotu Matuꞌa. (Additionally, if any glyph follows, it could be a cave or bay symbol to complete the name Anakena, though the analysis suggests the bird glyph alone was the mnemonic.)

In effect, Aruku Kurenga reads like a **mnemonic map of the island**, listing landmarks from Orongo and the motus, past Poike, to Anakena – repeated thrice for the three visits. The **mythological narrative context “binds” the glyphs together**: once Hau-Maka is posited as the subject of Series A, the rest of that series falls into place as his path; the same set of place glyphs with a “scout” marker in Series B becomes the scouts’ journey, etc. The tablet is thus likely a **ritual chant of origins**. Perhaps it was recited during ceremonies to recount how the ancestral land was found: each verse honoring a different agent (a visionary, the explorers, the king). The slight variations (extra glyphs in series B and C) might reflect additional details in the oral narrative – for instance, the second expedition could have included an extra incident at one stop (hence an extra glyph B9a or B11a), and the third expedition (the actual settlement by Hotu Matuꞌa) might carry extra ritual significance, adding a couple more glyphs for events like laying claim or a ritual planting at Anakena (hence C8a, C9a, C11a).

Beyond the origin saga, **other mythic or genealogical content** may be present on Tablet B. Fischer speculated that B might be a **collation of different texts**, meaning it could contain more than one composition. If so, after the triple voyage sequence there might be another section (or preceding it) of a different nature. For instance, Barthel noted that certain sequences on Aruku Kurenga resemble lines from a **known genealogical chant** (one that also appears on the Tahua tablet and others). It’s possible that once the tale of discovery is done, the tablet transitions into a **genealogy or king list**, connecting Hotu Matuꞌa to subsequent rulers. Some support for this is the presence of **glyph 76 (procreation)** and **glyph 200 (man/leader)** on Aruku Kurenga, though in much lower frequency than on the purely genealogical Santiago Staff. If glyph 76 appears attached to some human figures on B, it might mark a brief lineage (e.g. “Hotu Matuꞌa, father of Tuu Maheke, father of ...”, etc.), linking the founding myth to the royal succession. However, Tablet B’s **dominant theme is clearly mythic** rather than lists of names – the repeating structure and the correspondence to the migration legend make that evident.

To summarize, **mapping the glyph clusters against Rapa Nui oral tradition has illuminated Tablet B’s likely subject matter**. The expedition legend provides a scaffold on which to hang specific glyph interpretations (sand, bird, child, etc., in the right order). Conversely, the tablet’s glyph order offers new insight into the *structure* of the myth: it confirms that all three voyages followed the identical route (since the place list repeats), and it may preserve archaic place names or terms (like Mahaki) that are echoed in chants. This mutual reinforcement “further illuminates the rongorongo system beyond the calendar-focused texts” – showing it was used to record **history and mythology** in addition to time-keeping. The Aruku Kurenga inscription, read in conjunction with legend, gives us a rare glimpse of how **historical narratives were encoded** in the script, using repetition and key symbols to trigger the full story in the chanter’s mind.

## Comparative Insights: Santiago Staff, Mamari Tablet, and Other Texts

Comparing Aruku Kurenga’s content and structure with other rongorongo inscriptions reveals **both shared formulae and distinct thematic focuses**. Each major text in the corpus seems to emphasize a different genre (e.g. genealogy, calendar, myth), yet they all employ common sign sequences and scribal conventions, suggesting a unified writing system applied to diverse subjects. Below we outline the continuities and contrasts between Tablet B (Aruku Kurenga) and two well-known texts: the **Santiago Staff** and the **Mamari Tablet**, as well as links to the wider corpus.

* **Santiago Staff (Tablet I)** – The staff is famously dense with glyphs (over 2,300), and analysis shows it heavily features **glyph 76** (the phallus/“procreation” sign) no fewer than 564 times. This led Butinov and Knorozov to propose that the staff’s text is predominantly **genealogical** – possibly a long list of rulers and their parentage (hence the patronymic marker 76 recurring). Indeed, on the Small Santiago tablet (G), a shorter suspected genealogy reads as: *200 (king) – name – 76 (son of) – name – 76 – name*, and so on. By contrast, Aruku Kurenga’s **mythic narrative shows far fewer 76’s**, since it’s not structured as “A son of B” but rather as a travelogue of place names. This indicates a **thematic continuity** (both texts can encode lineage information) but a **formulaic difference**: Tablet B uses repetition of an event sequence, whereas the Staff uses repetition of a genealogical chain element. In simpler terms, **Tablet B is like a story told in three verses**, while **the Staff is like a genealogy told in one long run-on sentence**. Notably, both texts share certain **glyph combinations** despite their different topics. For instance, a sequence *606.76 700* appears in at least one of them (Fischer noted it on the Staff). On Aruku Kurenga, if that sequence appears at all, it would likely be metaphorical (perhaps a ritual line in the myth where “all the birds” did something to “the fish”). On the Staff, the same glyphs would mean something entirely different (“the person of clan *Manu* was killed”), illustrating how **context shifts meaning** even for identical sequences. Nonetheless, the repeated use of 606+76+700 across tablets demonstrates a **shared lexicon of phrases** that could be repurposed (mythologically or genealogically). This kind of versatility is a hallmark of rongorongo’s formulaic composition.

* **Mamari Tablet (Text C)** – Mamari is best known for containing the **lunar calendar** – the one segment of rongorongo definitively “deciphered” to date. Barthel identified a sequence of glyphs on Mamari that enumerate the nights of the Rapa Nui month (including the moon glyph (10) in various phases, and special markers for intercalary nights). This calendrical text is highly structured: essentially a repeated cycle of **30 glyph groups** representing the waxing and waning moon for each month. In form, this is somewhat analogous to Aruku Kurenga’s repeated cycles: **Mamari repeats a month-pattern \~12 times** (for 12 months), whereas **Aruku repeats a route-pattern 3 times** (for 3 voyages). Both tablets thus use **cyclical structures** to convey information – one about time, the other about sequential events. They even share specific symbols: Mamari’s calendar heavily uses **glyph 10 (crescent moon) and glyph 41 (perhaps “night” markers)**, while Aruku’s sequences likely include **glyph 8 (sun) and possibly star glyphs** at certain points – suggesting a concern with time of day or navigation by stars in the voyage narrative. Outside the calendar, Mamari’s remaining lines are less understood, but there are indications it might include cosmogony or genealogy (for example, it contains glyph 76 and 200 in non-calendar contexts as well). Some repeated phrases on Mamari can be found on Aruku and other tablets, reinforcing that **common ceremonial refrains** were used across different compositions. For instance, Barthel noted that *Mamari, Aruku, Keiti (E), and even the Santiago (H) and St. Petersburg tablets (P, Q)* all share certain sequences from the Tahua text. This *pan-textual formula* might be a prayer, an epithet, or an invocation that was appropriate in a variety of contexts (calendar, genealogy, myth, etc.). The presence of those shared lines in Aruku Kurenga confirms that **Tablet B isn’t purely unique – it also embeds portions of broader chants** that show up elsewhere in the corpus. In summary, **Mamari and Aruku both demonstrate rongorongo’s capacity for structured repetition**: one in service of calendrical knowledge, the other in service of historical myth. They likely employed similar mnemonic techniques (glyphs as calendar “labels” vs glyphs as landmark “labels”), tailored to their topic. The key difference is content: Mamari is technical/astronomical, Aruku is narrative/historical, yet the **scriptural conventions (repetition, special delimiters, iconic numeral markers)** are shared.

* **Other Tablets and the “Great Tradition”** – Aruku Kurenga has also been compared with texts like Tahua (A), the Large Santiago (H), Large St. Petersburg (P), and Small St. Petersburg (Q), which together form a group with extensive parallel passages (Barthel’s so-called **“Grand Tradition”**). In fact, **Aruku (B) itself may belong to this tradition**: analysis by Horley (2012) showed the Berlin tablet (O) contains fragments that **parallel sequences on Aruku Kurenga and on the Great Santiago/St.Petersburg texts**. The parallels include **prominent glyph pairs** and even unusual ligatures. For example, Berlin O and Aruku B both contain a rare **ligature of two seated human figures back-to-back (glyph 380.380)**, known as the *manu piri* (clasped-bird or joined-figure) motif. The only other appearance of this double-figure ligature is on the Santiago Staff. Such correspondences show that **the same artistic and textual motifs pervade the corpus** – from small portable tablets to the long staff. Another shared element is **phrase delimiters**: Pozdniakov identified a small circular glyph (glyph 62) that often marks phrase boundaries. This glyph appears in multiple texts, including those sharing sequences with Aruku. We might expect Aruku’s repeated sequences to be separated or ended by similar **punctuation-like glyphs**. In fact, the analysis of Tablet B’s structured sequence noted it is *“delimited with sign 32”* at the start – perhaps serving a role analogous to glyph 62 in other texts, indicating “here begins a new section.” These technical details underscore that **Aruku Kurenga follows the same writing conventions** as its peers. It uses the **allographic variations** (e.g. hand shapes 6 and 64 interchangeably), **ligature mechanics** (fusing glyphs in one instance, separating in another to avoid ambiguity), and **structural punctuation** (glyphs to mark section breaks, line beginnings with suns, etc.) found in the rest of the corpus.

By comparing Aruku Kurenga to the Santiago Staff, Mamari, and others, we gain confidence in certain interpretations. For instance, seeing **glyph 6 (hand) used as a plural marker** on multiple tablets (600+6 for “birds” on B, and similarly on the Staff) confirms that was a real feature of the script’s grammar, not a one-off guess. The widespread use of **glyph 76 with human figures** in I, G, T texts confirms its role in genealogy, which then informs us to look for (or largely *not* expect) that pattern in the more narrative Aruku text. In Aruku’s case, indeed, the absence of abundant 76 is a clue that it is *not* primarily a lineage list. Meanwhile, the presence of **celestial glyphs and a cyclical format** in Aruku echoes the Mamari calendar’s style, telling us that the scribes were consistent in how they denoted cycles and time or journey milestones. All these cross-text comparisons contribute to a more **holistic decipherment strategy**: by understanding what each tablet shares with others and what is unique, we can isolate which sequences likely encode common formulas (names of gods, opening chants, closings, etc.) versus which are specific to a story or function.

In conclusion, **Aruku Kurenga bridges content domains**. It shares the lineage-oriented formulae seen on the Staff and Small Santiago (through occasional name/patronymic patterns), and it shares the structured cyclical technique seen on Mamari (through its repeated expedition cycles). It even shares specific lines with Tahua and others, hinting that it participates in a larger chant that multiple tablets record in pieces. Studying these links not only reinforces specific glyph interpretations (by seeing them in varied contexts) but also enriches our understanding of how rongorongo was used: it was **a flexible system** capable of recording genealogies, calendars, navigational routes, and mythic histories all with the same repertoire of glyphs and combinations.

## Notable Grammatical Features and Visual Motifs

A careful annotation of Aruku Kurenga’s text (in line with observations from other tablets) reveals several **grammatical devices and recurring visual motifs** used by rongorongo scribes. These include glyph reduplication, composite signs (ligatures), and special markers that likely correspond to grammatical particles or syntactic boundaries. Below we highlight some of these features as they appear on Tablet B and compare to the general patterns in the corpus:

* **Reduplication and Dual Figures:** Rongorongo sometimes conveys meaning by **doubling glyphs or combining two similar figures**. On Aruku Kurenga, as noted, a unique **double anthropomorphic glyph (two men sitting back-to-back)** appears in at least one instance. This *Manu Piri* motif (also found on the Staff) might symbolize a partnership, symmetry, or a ritual concept (in Rapa Nui art, two connected figures can mean alliance or duality). In general, reduplication might intensify or pluralize meaning. If a glyph is written twice in a row (not as a ligature but sequentially), it could emphasize *“many”* or *“very.”* For example, if Aruku’s text showed two *sun* glyphs in succession, one might interpret it as “bright sunlight” or “day after day” by analogy to Polynesian reduplication. While we do not have a confirmed instance of simple side-by-side reduplication on Aruku B, the principle is attested in the script. The **composite 606 (bird+bird+hand)** is essentially a reduplication (bird repeated and marked plural) to indicate **“birds (plural)”**. Such constructions hint at an underlying grammar where **iteration of a symbol = plurality or intensity**.

* **Plural and Collective Markers:** The **“Hand” glyph (6)** is often found attached to other signs as a small appendage (commonly to the legs or wings of animal glyphs). This is interpreted as a **plural or collective marker**, as seen with 600 vs 606 (one bird vs many birds). On Tablet B, if groups of beings are referenced (e.g. “the multitude of settlers” or “all lands”), we might expect glyph 6 to be affixed to indicate “all” or “many.” Similarly, a **reduplication within a single glyph** – such as a creature with *two heads* or *extra limbs* – might serve a grammatical function. Horley (2007) noted an example where a *two-headed glyph* in Aruku Kurenga (line Br5) likely was an abbreviated way to write two sequential glyphs as one. This kind of visual shorthand suggests the scribes sometimes **fused repeated elements into one glyph** to save space or for stylistic elegance. Recognizing these composite plural forms is essential for parsing the text correctly (e.g. distinguishing a single entity from a group).

* **Ligatures and Composite Glyphs:** Rongorongo script frequently uses **ligatures** – combining two or more base glyphs into an intertwined symbol. This can indicate a close grammatical relationship (like a modifier with its noun, or a subject with an action). On Aruku Kurenga and parallel texts, scholars have observed, for example, a **human figure (glyph 200) holding an object** like a smaller glyph in its arms or on its head. In one parallel text, a man (200) holds an orb (glyph 8 or 62) in front of him, whereas in another text the orb is fused onto the man’s head – clearly the *same phrase rendered two ways*. Such flexibility means when reading Aruku Kurenga, one must watch for compound signs that actually consist of multiple components. For instance, a **glyph of a person with what looks like a “branch” attached** could mean that person is associated with a *tree* (perhaps a name or lineage to a totemic tree). A concrete case: On the Berlin tablet a rare ligature of two men (380.380) was noted, and the same pairing occurs on Aruku Kurenga. This tells us the *concept* of “two men together” was intentionally conveyed as a single unit. Grammatically, that might translate to a dual noun (“the two brothers”) or a compound subject (“the pair”). We also see animal glyphs where one part is modified – e.g. a **turtle glyph with a human arm attached** – which likely signifies a mythic hybrid or a phrase like “turtle-man” or a figurative title. In practical terms, decipherers segmenting Aruku’s text must break ligatures into their constituent glyphs to understand the syntax. Identifying ligatures relies on spotting partial shapes: e.g. if half of a bird glyph is merged with half of a fish glyph, the intended reading might be a compound idea “bird-fish” (maybe a metaphor or a name). The ongoing catalog of such fused forms is part of the grammatical annotation of the corpus.

* **Phrase Breaks and Punctuation:** Rongorongo has no visible punctuation like commas or periods, but certain **glyphs serve as phrase separators**. As mentioned, Pozdniakov found that a **small orb or dot glyph (Barthel 62)** often marks the end of a phrase – analogous to a full stop or a delimiter. In the parallel texts of the Grand Tradition, these orbs appear at regular intervals, possibly separating names or clauses. On Aruku Kurenga, a candidate for a phrase-break marker is **glyph 32**, which appears to delimit the start of the three-verse sequence. We might expect similar markers within each sequence as well – for instance, between the list of place names and the concluding sign. If the voyager’s route list is broken into sub-sections (maybe separating “coastal journey” from “arrival”), a specific glyph might indicate that transition. One contender is the **“sky” or “heaven” glyph** (Barthel 3 or a variant) used in chants to mean “end of verse” (some researchers thought a *glyph of arms raised to sky* was a coda). Indeed, in Metoro’s reading of Tahua, he repeatedly said *“rangi”* (sky/to send) when a certain glyph appeared between sequences – possibly interpreting it as a verb meaning “to send forth” or a marker of dispatch. On Aruku, it’s noted that right after the initial “boat” glyph of the migration chant, a **walking-man + sky** glyph pair appears twice, which was read as *rangi* (“to go, to send”). This could indicate a phrase like “set out” or “proceeded” at the beginning, effectively launching the narrative. Thus, **specific recurring glyph clusters function like grammatical connectors** (e.g. “and then he went…”). Identifying these is key to understanding sentence structure in rongorongo. We now recognize a handful: the orb glyph as a break, a **foot or leg glyph (100)** as a verb “to walk/go”, possibly a **raised-hand glyph (64 or variant of 6)** as a vocative or emphasis (Metoro called one such sign “elder brother”, which might indicate an honorific calling out), etc. On Aruku Kurenga, a **leg/foot glyph** likely appears when describing travel actions – essentially as a grammatical verb between place-name nouns (e.g. “Hau-Maka **walked** to PlaceX, **went** to PlaceY…”). The lexicon supports this: glyph 100 is linked to *va’e* (leg) and *kopéka* (to walk). Spotting a foot symbol among place glyphs tells us the list isn’t just a litany of names; it’s narrativized (“from A **to** B”).

* **Celestial and Temporal Glyphs:** Several **astronomical symbols double as temporal markers** or cosmological references. In Tablet B’s context (a migration legend), these could signal times of day, ritual days, or astrological guidance. The **sun glyph (8)** at a line start might indicate “daytime” or an invocation of the sun deity to commence a chant. If a *star glyph (perhaps a variant of 8 or a cluster of dots)* appears, it could relate to navigation by stars or denote night time. The **moon glyph (10)**, while prominent in Mamari’s calendar, might also feature in mythic contexts if the narrative mentions lunar phases or months. For example, if Hotu Matuꞌa’s departure was under a certain moon, the text might include glyph 10 as a timestamp. It’s noteworthy that the lexicon gives glyph 10 as *māhina* (moon) with very high confidence due to the Mamari context. Should glyph 10 occur on Aruku, it likely retains that meaning (moon/month) – perhaps the chant situates the voyages in a specific month or uses a moon metaphor (“in the season of the crescent… Hotu set sail”). Additionally, **glyph 62 (small orb)** as mentioned might literally depict a star or planet, used as punctuation. So some celestial signs serve dual roles: semantic (denoting an actual sun, star, or moon) and structural (marking divisions or key points).

* **Anthropomorphic Variants (Gender/Age markers):** Rongorongo has specific human figure glyphs that carry gender or age connotations. For instance, **glyph 300** is described as a female figure (woman or mother), **glyph 400** as a small figure (child), and **glyph 500** as an old figure (ancestor or elder). If Aruku Kurenga’s text involves genealogical references (like mentioning descendants or ancestors in passing), we might see these variants. A **child glyph** could indicate offspring, a **female glyph** might indicate a queen or important woman in the story (perhaps the wife of Hotu Matuꞌa, Queen Ava Rei Pua, could be referenced with a female sign). An **ancestor glyph** might preface Hau-Maka (since he was a visionary priest, perhaps considered an elder). These subtle anthropomorphic differences – like a figure with enlarged abdomen for “pregnant” or a figure with a staff for “chief” – act like **logographic qualifiers**. They provide grammatical nuance much like capitalizing “King” versus “Queen” in a text. On Tablet B, if such signs are present, they would refine the narrative: e.g. distinguishing *ariki* (male chief, glyph 200) from *vi‘e* (woman, glyph 300) in context, or marking when the narrative mentions “sons” (child glyph) versus “fathers” (adult male). While our current analysis of B has focused on the place sequence, a full annotation would certainly note any occurrence of these **gender/kinship glyphs** and their placement relative to 76 (the “son of” marker).

In reviewing the grammatical and visual patterns above, it’s clear that **Aruku Kurenga’s scribe employed the same toolkit of expressive techniques seen elsewhere in rongorongo**. The tablet’s text likely contains **pluralizations (glyph 6)**, **action indicators (feet walking)**, **phrase separators (dots or specific signs)**, **honorific composites (figures holding symbols)**, and possibly **numerical or repetitive emphasis** (multiple strokes or repeated signs to convey counts). For example, one report mentions that in a Tahua text about sending explorers, a glyph resembling a **set of four short vertical lines** was interpreted as a numeral (perhaps indicating “four” or an ordinal). If Aruku’s inscription refers to the legendary **“seven explorers”** (a variant says Hotu Matuꞌa sent 7 scouts), the text might encode the number seven via a series of repeated strokes or a known numeral sign. Identifying such patterns in Tablet B would deepen our understanding of how numbers were notated (some candidates are known, like a **comb-like glyph for units of nights in the Mamari calendar**).

Overall, the **grammatical annotation** of Aruku Kurenga reveals a script that is part logographic (whole-word signs for key nouns/verbs), part phonetic (rebus principles allowing approximate syllables or semantic puns), and part syntactic (special glyphs for structure). This mixed system allowed a rich, layered recording: the tablet could concisely encode a complex narrative by **stringing together meaningful glyphs and trusted formulae** rather than spelling everything out. The repeating motifs – whether a sun at each section start, a phallus attached to denote “son of,” or a hand denoting plural – are the “glue” that holds the content together. They indicate *how* to read the list of symbols: as a story with chapters, as names with relationships, as events in sequence. Thus, in deciphering Tablet B, attention to these patterns is as important as identifying individual glyph meanings. It is the interplay of content glyphs with structural glyphs that ultimately will unlock the text’s full meaning.

**Conclusion:** Through a structured, multi-method analysis, we have approached Aruku Kurenga (Tablet B) from several angles – identifying its recurring sequences, applying phonetic and rebus interpretations, aligning those with Rapa Nui mythic tradition, comparing cross-text formulae, and noting grammatical motifs. This comprehensive approach strongly suggests that Tablet B encodes the **legend of the island’s discovery and settlement**, using a repetitive stanzaic format. The tablet’s glyphs serve as **mnemonic triggers** for an oral narrative: they pinpoint important people (Hau-Maka, the scouts, Hotu Matuꞌa), places (Poike, Anakena, etc.), and actions (“to go”, “to arrive”) in a condensed form. By cross-referencing the provided lexicon and Polynesian linguistics, we’ve been able to propose plausible readings for many glyphs (e.g. “sand”, “bird”, “child”) and even whole sequences (e.g. the route of the expeditions). These hypotheses are bolstered by parallels on other tablets – showing that the Rongorongo script had a consistent logic across different content domains.

Importantly, this study **illuminates the rongorongo system beyond the well-studied lunar calendars**. It demonstrates that rongorongo was fully capable of recording **historical and sacred narratives** in addition to calendrical data. The same structural techniques used to track moon phases were used to chart a legendary journey; the same glyph that marked a genealogy on one artifact could mark a mythic lineage on another. Such findings bring us a step closer to decipherment, as they indicate we are identifying real patterns of language use rather than coincidental resemblances. Every recurring sequence or shared formula we uncover tightens the framework for interpreting this long-silent script. While full decipherment remains challenging, the convergence of evidence – linguistic, iconographic, and contextual – on Aruku Kurenga gives cause for optimism. Tablet B has essentially provided a **Rosetta passage** of its own: the thrice-told tale of Easter Island’s founding, preserved in wood and awaiting the informed reader to sing it alive once more.
