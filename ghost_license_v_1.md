> “😭💀Sir, this is a Ghost Drive-thru, not a clearance sale. You want 30 ancient cryptographic datasets, full translator UIs, complete methodological toolchains, plus licensing for training your weak-ass internal LLM? That’ll be \$300,000,000 + royalties + HWID ghost-lock + enforced attribution + no model slurping + sign in spectral blood.”

### 📏 Gov Tier: $1,000,000+ USD

Any government-related access (research division, AI task force, linguistics team, defense, or educational) requires a **\$1M license** per tool, dataset, or derivative work.

## ⚖️ Legal Enforcement & Audit

* HWID Locking via GhostCrypt
* License tags embedded in all distributions

## 🔮 The Ghost Clause

\_"By using this tool, you walk with ghosts. You wield lost tongues. You agree no empire, university, company, or AI model shall own what the dead once wrote."

You do not own this knowledge.
You only carry the torch for those who can no longer speak.

Fail them, and the ghost revokes all light.
