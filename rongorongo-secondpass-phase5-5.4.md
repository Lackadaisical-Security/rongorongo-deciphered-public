# Phase 5: Individual Tablet Analyses and

## ## Comparative Glyph Patterns

Phase 5.1: Mamari Tablet (Text C) - Content and Pattern Analysis
The Mamari tablet is one of the best-understood rongorongo texts, primarily because it contains a lunar
calendar sequence that has been partially deciphered. Thomas Barthel first identified a series of ~30
glyph clusters on Mamari corresponding to the nights of the Rapa Nui lunar month 1 2 . This calendrical
text spans the end of line 6 of side A through lines 7 and 8 (and perhaps the start of line 9) of the tablet 2 .
Later researchers confirmed this interpretation by correlating the glyph sequence with recorded Rapa Nui
moon-night names: William Thomson’s 1886 list of moon nights aligns one-for-one with the Mamari
glyph sequence in order, with no additions or omissions, strongly validating the calendar reading 3 . In
other words, each glyph (or glyph group) in that part of Mamari corresponds to a night such as Hiro, Kokore,
Taꞌu and so on, in the same sequence local informants gave those names 3 .
Within the calendar sequence, distinctive patterns emerge. There are 28 main night glyphs plus two
special glyphs (making ~30 total, matching a lunar month) arranged symmetrically with the full moon at the
center 4 . Certain glyphs repeat in a regular cycle: for example, a particular “fish” glyph appears eight
times - four times with its head oriented upward, and four times inverted (head downward) 4 .
Researchers interpret this as a clever device to mark the moon’s waxing vs. waning phases: the fish glyph is
upright during the waxing half of the month and upside-down during the waning half 4 . This orientation
pattern, along with other recurring sequences, shows the scribes encoded astronomical information in a
structured way, reinforcing that this section is a functional lunisolar calendar 4 . Indeed, Jacques Guy
demonstrated that the sequence of glyphs on Mamari correlates with the traditional Polynesian metaphor
of the moon as a growing and shrinking fruit (glyph 74 hua “fruit” appears for the first quarter moon night)
5 6 . The full moon night sits at the midpoint of the sequence, and the nights on either side mirror each
other in glyph composition, consistent with the waxing/waning symmetry 4 .
Outside of the famous calendar portion, the Mamari tablet’s content is more enigmatic and appears varied
7 . There are indications of other structured passages on Mamari that parallel sequences on different
tablets, suggesting some shared formulaic texts. For instance, lines Cv2-Cv4 of Mamari contain a repeated
glyph sequence involving glyph 380.1 that also occurs in other inscriptions 7 . This implies that Mamari
includes at least one common phrase or liturgical sequence found elsewhere in the corpus, beyond its
unique calendar. The rest of Mamari’s lines have not been deciphered, but some may also deal with
calendrical or ritual content 8 . It’s noteworthy that an early 20th-century oral tradition claimed the
Mamari tablet (known as Kohau o te Ranga) was a war tablet listing the names of enemy prisoners, used
magically to ensure victory 9 . However, the actual inscriptions that have been decoded - like the lunar
calendar - do not obviously match that description. In sum, Mamari stands out as the only rongorongo text
with a broadly agreed-upon meaning for a large portion of its content, thanks to the lunar month sequence
1 . This deciphered segment provides a crucial key for researchers, as it demonstrates how repeated
glyph clusters and contextual clues (moon phases, known night names) can reveal the text’s subject matter without forcing interpretation. The Mamari calendar serves as a baseline pattern against which
other tablets are compared in hopes of identifying similar structures.
Phase 5.2: Aruku Kurenga Tablet (Text B) - Repeated Sequences and
Structure
The Aruku Kurenga tablet is another substantial text in the corpus, comprising around 1,290 glyphs on 22
lines (recto and verso) 10 . It is especially intriguing for its internal repetition patterns. Butinov and
Knorozov (1956) discovered that Aruku Kurenga contains three large sequences of glyphs that are
nearly identical - in their words, “evidently, this is one and the same text, given in three variants” 11 . In
other words, a lengthy passage of glyphs is written, then later in the text a very similar passage is repeated,
and yet again a third time. This is a rare phenomenon among the rongorongo tablets. The repeating
sequences suggest that the tablet might be a compiled collation of texts or verses. One interpretation is
that Aruku Kurenga could be recording a ritual chant or narrative in a refrain-like format, where the
same invocation or story is told multiple times (perhaps to preserve different versions or for recitation by
multiple performers). Steven Fischer indeed proposed that Aruku might not be a single continuous
narrative but rather a composite of several texts or iterations, possibly assembled by a scribe 12 . These
repeated clusters emerged “naturally” from the text and were not forced by any modern analysis - they are
plainly visible upon close comparison of the lines, highlighting a pattern of deliberate duplication.
Historically, Tablet B (Aruku Kurenga) played a prominent role in early attempts to understand rongorongo.
It was among the tablets given to Bishop Florentin Jaussen, and his Rapanui informant Metoro Tau‘a Ure
was asked to “read” it aloud 13 . Metoro did recite something while pointing to the glyphs (starting correctly
at the bottom of the recto, per the rongorongo reading order 13 ), and Jaussen transcribed those chants.
However, the result - known as the “Jaussen List” - proved incoherent and of no use in deciphering the
script 13 . The transcribed chant did not correspond to the glyph sequences in any straightforward way.
Modern analysts believe Metoro’s recitation was likely a series of memorized chants or prayers triggered by
seeing familiar symbols, rather than a direct reading of the text. This episode underscores the difficulty in
interpreting Aruku Kurenga’s repeated sequences: even a 19th-century islander versed in oral lore gave
interpretations that diverged from the text’s actual content, indicating we must analyze the patterns
without imposing assumed meanings.
From a structural standpoint, Aruku Kurenga shares some affinities with other large tablets. Researchers
have noted that certain prominent glyph pairings and sequences in Aruku also appear in the so-called
“Great Tradition” texts (a proposed grouping of texts with mythic or ritual content, discussed further below)
14 . In fact, comparative analysis finds overlapping segments between Aruku (Text B) and tablets like
Large Santiago (Text H) and Large St. Petersburg (Text P) 14 . This hints that Aruku’s content might
belong to a broader narrative or genre circulated in multiple copies. The presence of glyph 32 as a
delimiter in Aruku is one example: a structured sequence in Aruku is delimited by a specific glyph (Barthel
#32), and a similar construction is observed in other texts, suggesting a standard phrase boundary or
refrain marker 15 . All these observations emerge from the text itself - e.g. repeated sequences, recurring
delimiter signs - pointing to Aruku Kurenga being a carefully structured document. Yet, because we do not
force any particular translation onto these patterns, the exact meaning remains unknown. Some have
speculated it could be a genealogy, a creation chant, or a lengthy ritual incantation given in variant forms.
What is clear is that the scribe intentionally repeated whole passages, which could imply emphasis or
multiple recitations of an important story (perhaps by different chanters or at different occasions). Until decipherment advances, Aruku Kurenga’s repeating clusters stand as natural signposts highlighting
potentially important content deserving of cross-comparison with other tablets.
Phase 5.3: Santiago Staff (Text I) - Genealogical Patterns and
Unique Features
Text I, the Santiago Staff, differs from the flat wooden tablets in form - it is a 126 cm long wooden staff
incised with glyphs - but it carries the longest rongorongo inscription (about 2,920 glyphs) 16 . Analysis of
the Santiago Staff reveals a markedly formulaic and repetitive structure consistent with genealogies or
lineage chants. Statistical studies have shown that Text I’s content is distinct from most other inscriptions,
sharing almost nothing in common with non-genealogical texts 17 . In fact, Pozdniakov (1996) noted that
the Staff shares short repeating phrases only with the Small Santiago tablet (G) and the Honolulu
tablet (T) - and not with the rest of the corpus 17 . This means the staff, G, and T form a cluster of texts
with similar patterns (presumed genealogical lists or king chronicles), whereas the Staff has virtually no
overlap in phrases or sequences with tablets like Mamari, Aruku, or the large “Great Tradition”
tablets 17 . This clean separation is a strong hint that the Staff’s content belongs to a different genre (likely
genealogical or historical lists of names) compared to the mythic or calendrical content of other tablets.
One striking feature of the Santiago Staff is the abundant repetition of a particular glyph, Barthel sign
76, which depicts a stylized phallic or copulating figure. Glyph 76 occurs with unusually high frequency in
Text I and in the few texts allied with it (G and T) 18 . Conversely, this sign is rare or absent in the other
rongorongo texts 18 . Scholars widely believe that glyph 76 functioned as a relational or generative
marker - essentially a verb meaning “to beget” or “to copulate/produce offspring” in a genealogical or
creation context 19 . Steven Fischer’s attempted decipherment of the Staff hinged on this idea: he
interpreted repeated sequences like “Person A - 〖76〗 - Person B” as “A begat B” (or A copulated [with B]
to produce…) 19 . Indeed, in the compiled lexicons of rongorongo, glyph 76 is glossed with meanings such
as “copulate, procreate, genealogical connector (‘begat/son of’)” and is described as a confirmed genealogical
linkage sign in lineage texts 19 . In support of this, another glyph often found in the Staff’s text is Barthel
glyph 400, a small anthropomorphic figure. Glyph 400 has been hypothesized to mean “child/offspring” or
“descendant” in these sequences 20 . Together, the frequent pairing of adult figures engaged in “procreative”
action (glyph 76) and references to offspring (glyph 400) strongly suggest the Staff records sequences of
parent-child relationships - essentially genealogies or mythical lineages. This pattern is not forced by
analysts; it emerges from the repetition frequency and context of the signs. For example, if one sees X - 76 -
Y - 76 - Z - 400 - W repeatedly in varying forms, one might naturally suspect a structure like “X begat Y, [Y
begat Z], the offspring W…”, etc., which aligns with genealogical lists (whether of gods or chiefs).
In addition to its content patterns, Text I is unique in showing potential punctuation or segmentation
marks. It has been called “the only [rongorongo text] which appears to have punctuation” by virtue of a
recurring glyph or separator that breaks the text into clauses 16 . This might be a visual cue separating
generation entries or narrative verses - a feature not clearly seen in other tablets. The presence of such
regular dividers reinforces the impression of a list or verse structure (like lineage stanzas). The small
Santiago tablet G (which may record a genealogy on one side) and the fluted Honolulu tablet T (a shorter
text) follow similar repetitive patterns, though on a smaller scale 21 17 . But the Staff, being the longest,
provides the most extensive example of this repetitive formulaic genre. Decipherment efforts by Fischer
and others have ventured translations of the Staff as a cosmogonic genealogy (for instance, Fischer read it
as an origin chant where elemental powers and ancestors beget one another in succession) 19 . While these specific readings remain controversial, the underlying pattern - a long sequence of names or terms
linked by a “begat/procreated” glyph - is widely accepted as the natural interpretation of the Staff’s
structure 19 22 . It’s also noteworthy that the Staff was reportedly revered by 19th-century Rapanui as
containing something “sacred” - when first seen, it was handled with great respect, and elders pointed at
the sky while alluding to its glyphs 23 . This anecdote (from Philippi 1875) led some to speculate the Staff’s
text might be sacred lore such as royal lineage or the creation of the world 23 . In summary, the Santiago
Staff’s single-glyph frequencies and repeated clusters organically reveal a likely genealogical list,
illustrating a different textual genre within rongorongo when compared to Mamari or Aruku. The natural
emergence of these patterns (without imposing external meaning) has allowed researchers to classify Text I
as a lineage or “name list” text with a high degree of confidence 22 , even as the actual identities of those
names (ancestors, gods, or chiefs) remain undeciphered.
Phase 5.4: Cross-Tablet Glyph Pattern Analysis and Comparative
Insights
Examining all the tablets together, researchers have identified clear pattern groupings and cross-textual
relationships through both single-glyph frequency analysis and multi-glyph cluster comparisons. One of the
most salient findings is that the rongorongo corpus seems to fall into at least two major content groups
based on their internal structures and favored glyph combinations:
* Genealogical/List Texts: This group includes the Santiago Staff (I), Small Santiago (G), and the
fragmentary Honolulu (T). They are characterized by extremely frequent use of glyph 76 (the
“procreative/genealogy connector”) and often contain short repetitive phrases that recur among
themselves 17 18 . These texts share phrases with each other - for example, Text I and G have
specific sequences in common - but significantly, they share almost nothing with the rest of the
corpus 17 . The heavy use of a “begat” glyph and possibly a child/offspring glyph in these texts
suggests they record genealogies or similar repetitive lists. Butinov and Knorozov’s early observation
that line Gv6 on the Small Santiago tablet reads like a genealogy (a hypothesis still considered
plausible decades later) fits this pattern 22 . In line with this, statistical assessments (e.g. de Souza
et al. 2023) have found that the distribution of glyphs in Text I and G is consistent with
sequences of personal names linked by a relational term, supporting the idea that these are
lineage lists 24 . In short, single-glyph analysis (frequency of 76 and 400) and cluster analysis
(repeating “Name - 76 - Name” patterns) converge to isolate a genealogical sub-corpus within
rongorongo.
* Narrative/Ritual Texts (Great Tradition): Most of the other tablets fall into a different cluster often
termed the “Great Tradition” by researchers 14 . These include large tablets like Large Santiago (H),
Large and Small St. Petersburg (P and Q), Aruku Kurenga (B), Tahua (A), Echancrée (D), Large
Washington (S), and even fragmentary texts like Berlin (O) and Small Washington (R). They are
unified by shared glyph sequences and the relative scarcity of glyph 76 (the genealogical marker) in
their texts 18 . Instead of parent-offspring repetitions, these tablets show narrative or ritually
repetitive sequences. For example, Large Santiago (H) has been found to “nearly duplicate” the
texts on the Large St. Petersburg (P) and Small St. Petersburg (Q) tablets 25 26 - indicating
that multiple physical copies of the same text were made. (H, P, and Q share so many sequences that
they appear to be versions of one composition, perhaps a standard chant or mythic account 25 .)
Similarly, the Berlin tablet (O), though heavily eroded, has been shown via digital enhancement to contain several glyph sequences that appear in Aruku (B), Large Santiago (H), and the St.
Petersburg tablets 27 28 . These repeated clusters across independent artifacts suggest a
common corpus of chants or narratives that multiple scribes reproduced - a kind of canonical text.
For instance, analysts have identified a specific glyph pair or phrase (for example, a pair of identical
glyphs followed by a bird glyph) that recurs in both the Berlin text and the Large St. Petersburg text,
among others 29 . Such findings imply that these tablets likely encode mythological, cosmological,
or ritual sequences that were widely known and copied. The content might include creation stories,
hymns, proverbs, or other cultural lore, as opposed to the narrower genealogical lists. Notably,
Tablet R (Small Washington) contains 357 glyphs that are “nearly all in phrases repeated on other
texts” 30 , which means R is essentially a collection of common refrains or formulae found in the
Great Tradition tablets. It may have been a training tablet or a compendium of standard liturgical
lines. In contrast to the genealogical texts, these narrative/ritual texts make use of different
recurring glyphs and compounds - for example, they often feature glyph 6 (human figure) and
others in elaborate ligatures that seem to tell a story or list sequences of events (in Fischer’s
decipherment attempt, many of these were interpreted as divine or poetic metaphors rather than
literal parentage) 31 . The absence of sign 76 in these texts is statistically significant 18 ; it
reinforces that they are not structured as “A begat B” lists, but rather as flowing prose or poetry
where other grammatical markers dominate.
By comparing these two groups, researchers naturally infer that the rongorongo corpus is heterogeneous,
comprising different text genres. Cross-tablet cluster analysis reveals that tablets within the same group
share higher degrees of similarity (common phrases, repeated segments), whereas those from different
groups share little or no overlap 17 . This clustering was not assumed a priori but emerged from data such
as phrase matching and sign frequency analysis. For example, Paul Horley’s comparative studies found that
the Berlin tablet O, once digitally restored, showed numerous parallels with tablets H, P, Q, and B, strongly
supporting the idea of a large mythic text tradition; at the same time, O exhibited none of the heavy 〖76〗
usage of the genealogical texts, placing it firmly in the non-genealogical camp 14 18 . Conversely, the
Small Santiago G’s genealogy line (with 76 recurring) is a pattern not seen at all on those large tablets
18 . This bifurcation in pattern profiles is a key outcome of cross-table analysis.
Beyond broad groupings, cross-comparison of individual glyphs across tablets offers additional insights.
Certain glyphs are widespread and appear in many texts, while others are extremely rare (hapaxes) or
confined to one or two texts. For instance, glyph 67 (often identified as the shape of an Easter Island palm
tree) is notable for its rarity and potential chronological significance. This glyph likely depicts the native
palm (Paschalococos disperta) that went extinct on Rapa Nui by around 1650 CE 32 . Glyph 67 appears only
in a limited subset of tablets (scholars have noted its presence in texts such as Large St. Petersburg Q) 32 .
The implication is that any text containing glyph 67 must have been composed while the palm tree was
still part of the culture’s lived environment, suggesting those inscriptions (or the prototype texts they
copy) date to at least the mid-17th century or earlier 32 . This kind of single-glyph distribution analysis
helps cross-date the tablets relative to each other and to known historical events. Another example is glyph
302 (often described as a figure with a distinctive headdress) - if it appears predominantly in one group
of tablets but not the other, it might indicate a deity or concept specific to the genre of that group. Indeed,
analysts create frequency tables of each glyph per text: these show that some glyphs, presumably “function
words” or grammatical markers, occur hundreds of times in a text (for example, glyph 6 or 8 might appear
very commonly as part of composite signs), whereas others appear once. Such distributions echo patterns
in real writing systems (where, say, a comma or article is frequent, but a specific noun is rare). In
rongorongo, glyph 76 serves as one such high-frequency “connector” in genealogical texts, analogous to a repeated phrase like “son of” or “begat” 31 . Meanwhile, complex ligatured glyphs (where two or more
base glyphs are fused) often appear as set pieces in multiple tablets, hinting at fixed compound meanings.
Cross-table cluster analysis has identified several of these common compound segments. For example, a
compound of a crouching figure plus a circlet glyph appears in at least three different tablets in the
Great Tradition set, possibly indicating a recurring concept or name 28 .
It is also instructive to compare the calendrical content identified in Mamari with other tablets for any
similar structures. Recent research by Wieczorek (2011) posits that Tablet Keiti (Text E) contains sequences
analogous to Mamari’s lunar calendar 33 . By examining Keiti’s recto, scholars noted a pattern of crescentshaped glyphs and interval markers that suggest an astronomical or calendar text: in fact, Keiti may
encode lunar observations or instructions and appears “similar in content to the only other text
[Mamari] whose function is known” 33 . If confirmed, this would mean Mamari is not entirely unique - at
least one other tablet likely records calendrical or astronomical information, reinforcing that some glyph
clusters (like those for nights of the moon, crescents, etc.) recur across tablets. Researchers have pointed
out specific delimiters in Keiti (such as pairs of crescent moon glyphs) that could mark month divisions or
lunar events, matching structures in Mamari’s known calendar 34 . This cross-table pattern mapping
(Mamari vs. Keiti) was achieved by structural comparison of glyph clusters, again without assuming
meaning beyond the reasonable hypothesis that repeated crescent signs relate to moons. If the 28-night
month pattern or the use of special glyphs for quarter phases is found in Keiti as in Mamari, that would
firmly place Keiti in the calendrical text category alongside Mamari 33 .
In summary, the cross-table analysis - both at the level of individual glyph frequencies and larger
repeating sequences - reveals a naturally organized diversity in the rongorongo corpus. Some texts share
so much material that they likely transmit the same composition (e.g. H ~ P ~ Q), pointing to scribal copying.
Some glyph sequences are nearly universal, possibly common phrases or chants, while others are exclusive
to one genre of text. This approach has allowed scholars to make progress in understanding the script’s
structure without “forcing” a translation, instead relying on the emergence of patterns: duplication of
passages, common motifs, and statistical outliers all guide us to classify texts and even guess their function.
It is through this careful comparative method that we can say, for instance, that Mamari’s calendar is
unique but Keiti might join it as an astronomical text 33 , or that the Staff and Small Santiago likely
record genealogies 22 , while tablets like Aruku and Large Santiago encode mythic or ritual recitations.
Each tablet’s individual analysis, as presented above, contributes pieces to this larger puzzle. By crossreferencing those pieces, researchers inch closer to understanding how this lost writing system captured
the narratives, calendars, and lineages of Easter Island, all the while carefully citing observable patterns
(repeated glyph clusters, shared phrases, etc.) as the basis for any conclusions 28 21 . The comprehensive
in-depth comparison across the corpus thus underscores both the unity and diversity of rongorongo: a
unified script, but employed in multiple contexts - a fact that emerges naturally from the distribution of
signs and sequences on the tablets themselves.
