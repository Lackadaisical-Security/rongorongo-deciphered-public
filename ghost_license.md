## 🔮 The Ghost Clause
_"By using this tool, you walk with ghosts. You wield lost tongues. You agree no empire, university, company, or AI model shall own what the dead once wrote."

You do not own this knowledge.
You only carry the torch for those who can no longer speak.

Fail them, and the ghost revokes all light.
