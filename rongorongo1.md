# Deciphering the Rongorongo Script: History, Symbolism, and Attempts at Translation

## Overview of Rongorongo

**Rongorongo** is an ancient system of glyphs from Rapa Nui (Easter Island) that remains one of the world’s great undeciphered scripts. It was first noted by Westerners in the 19th century, when missionaries and explorers discovered wooden objects covered in mysterious symbols. The glyphs are stylized outlines of humans, animals, plants, and geometric shapes, often with characteristic eye-like dots on heads. They were carved in rows that read in an alternating direction (*reverse boustrophedon*), with the reader turning the tablet 180° at the end of each line. To maximize writing space, some tablets have shallow grooves (fluting) incised as guides for the text lines.

Numerous scholars have attempted to decipher rongorongo, but **no translation is yet accepted**. Apart from recognizing a *lunar calendar* sequence and possibly a *genealogical list* on certain tablets, the glyphs cannot currently be read as language. If rongorongo truly encodes writing (as opposed to a non-linguistic mnemonic system), it would represent a very rare independent invention of writing by an isolated culture. Recent findings support its authenticity: for example, radiocarbon dating of one tablet’s wood suggests it was made from a tree felled in the late 15th or early 16th century – **predating European contact** by over 200 years. This indicates the script was developed by the Rapa Nui people without outside influence, laying to rest earlier speculation that it was inspired by European writing. Intriguingly, the script’s symbols bear no obvious relation to any other known writing system.

## The Rongorongo Corpus and Characteristics

Only about **two dozen inscribed objects** have survived, making the corpus frustratingly small for decipherment. These were all collected in the late 1800s and are now kept in various museums; none remain on Easter Island itself. The majority are wooden tablets of irregular shape (often made from driftwood planks), ranging from a few inches to a few feet in length. In addition, the corpus includes a wooden *chief’s staff* (covered in glyphs along its length), a small human figurine with glyphs carved on it (*tangata manu* statuette), and two ornamental gorget boards (*reimiro* pendants) inscribed with short texts. A few petroglyphs on Easter Island stone might also contain brief rongorongo inscriptions, though these are faint and disputed. In total, scholars count **roughly 15,000 glyphs** across all known texts – a very limited dataset compared to other ancient scripts. About **400 distinct glyph shapes** have been catalogued across these texts, depicting figures such as humans (often stylized in a sitting posture), bird-like and fish-like creatures, plants, celestial symbols, and abstract designs. However, many of these may be variants or compound signs: modern analysis suggests the core inventory could be much smaller (on the order of 50–60 basic signs) once ligatures and allographs are accounted for. For instance, certain glyphs that Barthel’s early catalog treated as separate were later shown to be the same sign drawn with minor variations or attached to different figures. In 2007, comparative studies by Konstantin Pozdniakov and colleagues concluded that **52 fundamental glyphs** account for 99.7% of all occurrences in the corpus. This compression of the sign list hints that rongorongo might function as a **syllabary** (phonetic signs for syllables) augmented by some logograms or rebus symbols, rather than a vast pictographic lexicon. Still, without knowing the sound values of those signs, the script remains unreadable.

Physically, the texts were incised with simple tools (obsidian flakes or shark teeth) on native Pacific rosewood in most cases. Interestingly, a few tablets are on foreign wood (like European oak or South African yew) repurposed from ship wreckage, indicating islanders were so wood-poor that they even engraved driftwood of foreign origin. Lines of glyphs often wrap around the edges of a tablet, showing that scribes filled every available space. The painstaking carving and the sacred value later ascribed to these tablets suggest that **rongorongo literacy was restricted to a small elite**. Indeed, Rapa Nui oral history says that only certain wise men or priests (*tangata rongorongo* – “men of rongorongo”) could read the tablets, and that they were used as ceremonial artifacts rather than everyday records. Readers likely chanted or recited the texts from memory, using the glyphs as prompts – as reflected in the very name *rongorongo*, which means “to recite, to chant out” in the Rapa Nui language.

## Cultural Context and Oral Traditions

Understanding rongorongo may ultimately require **connecting the symbols to Rapa Nui’s oral traditions, mythology, and language**. Early islanders did not leave behind libraries of books or lengthy historical chronicles; instead, their knowledge was preserved in songs, genealogies, proverbs, and ceremonial chants passed down through generations. The rongorongo tablets were likely a means to record or prompt these **traditional chants and information**. In fact, 19th-century informants described different categories of tablets by content. For example, *kōhau taꞌu* (“lines of years”) were said to record annals or royal genealogies, *kōhau ika* (“lines of fishes”) listed warriors killed in war (a pun, since **“ika” means both “fish” and figuratively a war casualty** in the Rapa Nui tongue), and *kōhau raŋa* (“lines of fugitives”) listed refugees or exiles from conflicts. These hints suggest that some tablets carried historical or genealogical lists, while others might encode mythic or ritual texts. If true, it aligns with the idea that a chanter specialized in one tablet (say, a genealogy) might not automatically know how to “read” a tablet of a different type (say, a navigational chant), unless they had learned that particular content by heart. This could explain later reports that even among the last elders who **claimed some knowledge of rongorongo, no one could read all texts** – each expert had specific pieces memorized, reinforcing the notion of a mnemonic device tied to oral lore.

Many glyph shapes likely hold **symbolic significance recognizable to people familiar with Rapa Nui culture**. Scholars have noted that some signs appear to be stylized representations of important concepts: for instance, a glyph depicting a figure with a large circular head and outstretched arms may correspond to the full moon or an associated deity. In fact, one particular glyph (Barthel’s glyph 152) in the Mamari tablet sequence was identified as a pictograph of “the old woman lighting a fire in the sky” – a Polynesian metaphor for the **full moon** (akin to a “man in the moon” myth). This identification was key to recognizing the Mamari tablet’s calendar: the sequence of moon phases is anchored by this full-moon symbol, flanked by crescents representing nights of the lunar month. Likewise, the glyph of a fish (glyph 700) seems to function as a **rebus for death or victims** in certain contexts, consistent with the term *ika* “fish” doubling for “war casualty”. Such examples show how **mythology and language cues have helped decode bits of meaning**. By cross-referencing the glyph sequences with known Rapa Nui myths, chants, and wordplay, researchers have been able to make educated guesses for some signs. For example, when 19th-century islander Ure Vaʻe Iko recited a chant known as *Atua Matariri* (a creation chant listing male and female beings procreating to produce elements of nature), this provided clues that a repeated glyph sequence on the tablets might likewise be describing progenitors and offspring in mythic terms. Ethnographic data like the ancient **Rapa Nui calendar** (names of months and nights) collected by early researchers have directly aided interpretations: the only portion of rongorongo text **fully “decoded” so far is a calendrical list** on the Mamari tablet, which matches the sequence of nights in the Rapa Nui lunar month (including the occasional intercalary nights used to align with the moon’s cycle). By knowing the traditional names and order of these nights (recorded by an islander in the 19th century), scholars could identify the corresponding glyphs for each phase of the moon and even the markers indicating when an extra night should be inserted. This success underscores the value of aligning the script with **known cultural content** – a process that might be extended by comparing other glyph sequences with chants about genealogy, navigation, or origin myths that were preserved orally.

Unfortunately, much of Rapa Nui’s oral heritage was lost or fragmented due to the catastrophic population collapse in the 1800s (slave raids and disease decimated the island’s priestly classes), and conversion to Christianity led to many rongorongo tablets being destroyed or hidden. Thus, we have only tantalizing fragments of chants and scant word glosses from the few islanders who had any familiarity with the script when outsiders arrived. Nonetheless, those fragments form an important part of the decipherment story.

## 19th-Century Attempts and Native Insights

The first person to seriously investigate rongorongo was **Florentin-Étienne Jaussen**, the Bishop of Tahiti, in the late 1860s. Islanders who had converted to Christianity gifted Bishop Jaussen a tablet in 1868, sparking his interest. He instructed Father Hippolyte Roussel on Easter Island to collect more tablets and find anyone who could still read them. Roussel managed to send a few tablets to Tahiti, but found no one on the island willing or able to read them. However, by chance an Easter Island laborer named **Metoro Tauʻa Ure** was in Tahiti, and Jaussen was told Metoro knew how to recite the tablet texts “by heart”. Over the next few years (c. 1869–1874), Jaussen sat with Metoro and attempted to transcribe and translate four tablets (today known as tablets **A** *Tahua*, **B** *Aruku Kurenga*, **C** *Mamari*, and **E** *Keiti*). Metoro would look at the glyphs and chant aloud; Jaussen recorded these chants and later published a glossary of glyphs with the Rapanui words Metoro ostensibly gave for them. This list – the *Jaussen list* – was initially hailed as a potential **“Rosetta Stone” for rongorongo**, but it turned out to be deeply puzzling and of limited use for decipherment. Metoro’s recitations were not literal readings of the glyphs; modern analysis suggests he may have been reciting known prayers or myths triggered by looking at the symbols, rather than actually decoding each sign. He often gave different words for the same glyph at different times, and some identifications were clearly erroneous (for instance, Jaussen’s notes list a glyph as meaning “porcelain,” a material nonexistent in Rapa Nui – though this was later revealed to be a mistranslation of Metoro’s word for a *cowrie shell*, which in French was *porcelaine*). Decades later, scholar Thomas Barthel combed through Jaussen’s manuscripts and found evidence that Metoro **did not truly understand the script’s content**: he “read” one tablet’s lines in the wrong direction and failed to recognize obvious pictorial signs like the full moon symbol on the Mamari tablet. These inconsistencies imply that Metoro was likely improvising a chant based on memory and the sight of familiar symbols, rather than performing an accurate reading. As a result, the Jaussen list provided only a few credible clues (and many red herrings) for later scholars.

Another 19th-century effort came from **William J. Thomson**, a U.S. Navy officer who visited Easter Island in 1886. Thomson met perhaps the last living Rapanui who had been trained (though never fully initiated) in rongorongo literacy: an elderly man named **Ure Vaʻe Iko**. Ure had been an apprentice to a rongorongo expert under the last king, but the practice was interrupted by the deadly Peruvian slave raids in the 1860s. Initially, Ure Vaʻe Iko refused to “read” the tablets for Thomson – he feared it would anger his Christian ministers and jeopardize his soul to invoke the old pagan chants. Only after persistent gifts did Ure agree to recite from memory some of the old chants, using photographs of tablets that Thomson had obtained. Thomson (with the help of an interpreter, Alexander Salmon Jr.) managed to record **five oral texts** dictated by Ure, purportedly corresponding to five different tablets. These included chants known by their first lines or subjects, such as *Apai*, *Atua Matariri* (the aforementioned creation chant), *Eaha to rā nā ariki Kete* (perhaps a king’s lament), *Ka ihi uila* (meaning unclear), and *Ate henga o te kokū* (possibly a love song, also called *Ate ā Renga Hōkau* in some sources). Initially, this was a breakthrough – here were actual Rapanui texts ostensibly derived from rongorongo tablets. However, the results were again problematic. Salmon’s written Rapanui was imperfect, and when ethnographer Alfred Métraux decades later re-transcribed and translated these chants with better linguistic understanding, **the content did not clearly match the tablet inscriptions**. The chants start out coherent but then become “clearly ridiculous towards the end,” suggesting Ure’s memory may have faltered or he improvised fillers. For example, one chant that Salmon thought was a love song turned out to be a garbled mix of Rapanui and Tahitian words with no clear meaning. Still, Thomson’s contributions were not in vain: **among the data he gathered were the names of the nights of the lunar month and the months of the year** in the old Rapa Nui calendar. This list of 13 month-names (one more than the expected 12, because of an occasional intercalary month) later proved crucial for deciphering the structure of the Mamari tablet’s calendar segment. By comparing Thomson’s month names and their order with the repeating glyph patterns on the tablet, researchers confirmed that one line of glyphs on Mamari indeed enumerates the nights of each lunar month in sequence. Thomson’s records thus provided a culturally anchored “key” to interpret at least one portion of a tablet – a small but significant victory in rongorongo research.

In summary, the 19th-century attempts involving the last native informants yielded mixed results: **they preserved a few genuine pieces of the puzzle (like the calendar terms and the format of creation chants), but they did not crack the script outright**. These accounts do suggest that rongorongo inscriptions likely encode genealogies, rituals, procreation chants, or historical lists, since those were the kinds of texts the elders recited. This helped later researchers target their hypotheses toward those genres.

## 20th-Century Scholarly Approaches

After the turn of the 20th century, with no living readers of rongorongo left, the task of decipherment fell entirely to linguists and archaeologists. A major milestone was the work of **Thomas S. Barthel**, a German ethnologist who in the 1950s undertook the first comprehensive cataloging of all known rongorongo texts. Barthel traveled to museums to examine the tablets and in 1958 published *“The Rongorongo of Easter Island”*, which presented a standardized transcription system (assigning each distinct glyph a numerical code) and hand-drawn tracings of the inscriptions A through X (covering over 99% of the corpus). Barthel’s corpus became the foundation for virtually all later analyses. Importantly, **Barthel confirmed the repeating pattern of glyphs on tablet C (Mamari) as a lunar calendar** – the one portion of rongorongo now considered partially deciphered. In a *Scientific American* article in 1958, he explained how a sequence of 29 glyphs on Mamari corresponds to the nights of the moon, including two special glyphs for the “leap nights” needed to synchronize the lunar cycle with the calendar. This finding was later refined by researchers like Jacques Guy, who noted the glyphs likely encode an *astronomical rule* for when to insert those extra nights based on observing the moon’s appearance (an ingenious detail that implies a practical purpose for the tablet). The Mamari calendar remains **the sole rongorongo text whose function is understood** (we know it’s a calendar) – even though we still cannot pronounce the glyphs, we can tell what they *mean* in that context.

Another pivotal study came from **Nikolai Butinov and Yuri Knorozov**, two Russian cryptographers who in 1957 applied frequency analysis to the rongorongo texts. Knorozov was famed for cracking the Maya script, and he turned his attention to Easter Island’s glyphs with high hopes. Butinov and Knorozov identified a **repetitive structure on the *Small Santiago Tablet*** (tablet G) that they hypothesized was a **genealogy or king-list**. In lines Gv5–6, they noticed a sequence of about 15 glyph groups following a clear pattern: one particular human figure glyph (numbered 200) kept alternating with another glyph (number 76) attached as a suffix. They proposed that glyph 200 could be a title like “king” or a personal name, and glyph 76 could mark descent (they likened it to a patronymic marker meaning “son of”). Thus a repeating string of “200 – 76 – X – 200 – 76 – Y – 200 – 76 – Z …” would read as something like: “King A, son of B; King B, son of C; King C, son of D …”. In other words, the text might be listing successive chiefs and their fathers. This **genealogical interpretation** is widely regarded as plausible. If correct, it has several exciting implications: first, certain recurring sets of glyphs could be identified as personal names (the names of kings or ancestors) in other texts as well. Second, it would shed light on the content of one of the most enigmatic objects, the **Santiago Staff**. The Santiago Staff is a wooden staff covered in a single line of over 2,300 glyphs – the longest rongorongo text known. On the staff, glyph 76 (the proposed “son of” marker) occurs **564 times** – about one fourth of all symbols on it. This strongly suggests the staff is dominated by genealogical or repetitive phrases, possibly a litany of names. In fact, island oral history had a concept of *kohau ika* (lines of “fish”) as war casualty lists; if glyph 700 (a fish) on the staff is read as “victim” or “dead person”, then sequences like “X 76 700” on the staff might mean “X, son of So-and-so, was killed”. The staff could then be a ceremonial roll of warriors or tribes and their fates, essentially a **memorial list**. While no one has definitively **proven** Butinov and Knorozov’s genealogy reading by translating it into actual names, their pattern-finding approach was a breakthrough. It showed that the script has internal structure consistent with language-like information (not random or purely decorative). Even critics of rongorongo-as-language concede that the genealogy hypothesis fits well and has not been contradicted by any evidence. It’s notable that Knorozov’s team also observed something curious: the statistical distribution of glyphs did not match what one would expect if the texts were written in normal Polynesian language. Common grammatical particles in Rapa Nui (like *te, he, ki*, etc.) did not appear at high frequencies in the glyph sequences. This suggested either the language behind rongorongo was not standard Rapa Nui *or* that the texts were written in a very condensed, telegraphic style (omitting many grammatical words). Another possibility is that if rongorongo is a mnemonic device, it might not encode every word of a chant—only the key content words, leaving the chanter to fill in the grammar from memory. This line of reasoning bolstered the theory that **rongorongo might be a proto-writing or mnemonic system rather than a full script**.

Throughout the latter 20th century, other scholars offered various decipherment claims – many of them far-fetched or outright fanciful. A few proposed transcribing rongorongo into Polynesian syllables, others thought it was a migration record from the Indus Valley (an extreme outlier theory), and some non-scholarly enthusiasts produced “translations” that read like Bible passages or alien messages. The academic consensus, however, remained skeptical of any claimed solution. **Any real decipherment must demonstrate a pattern that holds across the corpus and yields coherent meaning,** not just isolated readings. A key test is to apply a decipherment to a new text and see if it produces a sensible result – a criterion no one has met so far. By the 1980s, researchers like Jacques Guy, Edmundo Edwards, and others were focusing on comparing texts to find structural clues rather than proposing outright translations. Guy, for instance, contributed insights into the lunar calendar glyphs and pointed out errors in earlier readings, while the Centro Etnológico in Chile (CEIPP) worked on verifying Barthel’s transcriptions with new tablet rubbings and photos. The picture emerged of rongorongo as highly repetitive and possibly formulaic. Some tablets contain identical or near-identical sequences, indicating either copies of the same text or a common liturgical refrain. Pozdniakov’s research in the 1990s and 2000s dramatically showed how **phrases were reused**: he identified over a hundred recurring sequences (10–100 glyphs long) that appear on multiple tablets in different order or context. This suggests the content was modular – perhaps standardized verses or lists that scribes recombined, rather than free prose. Tellingly, Pozdniakov noted that the texts (except for two unusual cases) do not look like continuous narrative or varied content; instead they seem to be constructed from a limited set of stock phrases and thus “**not integral texts**” in the sense of a story or chronicle. This supports the notion that the tablets might be ritual chants, genealogies, or other structured lists, rather than creative literature or detailed historical chronicles.

## Contemporary Theories and the Path Forward

One of the most publicized modern claims was made by independent linguist **Steven Roger Fischer** in the 1990s. In 1995, Fischer announced to much fanfare that he had “cracked” rongorongo, asserting that he deciphered it as a set of **creation chants** about the origin of the world. Fischer’s interpretation centered on the **Santiago Staff**. He observed that this long text is uniquely divided by 100+ vertical strokes, almost like punctuation, into sections. He agreed with the earlier insight that glyph 76 was attached to the first glyph of most sections, but diverged in meaning: Fischer identified glyph 76 as a **phallic symbol** (literally a depiction of a male organ). He claimed that the staff consists of hundreds of repeated phrases of the form **“X ♂ Y ⇒ Z”**, which he read as *“X copulated with Y, and produced Z.”* In Fischer’s reading, the example sequence 606-76-700-8 was interpreted thus: glyph 606 (a bird-man figure) = “all the birds” (by taking part of the glyph as a plural marker), glyph 76 = “mated with”, glyph 700 (fish) = “fish”, glyph 8 (a sun-like symbol) = “sun”. Therefore, he translated that segment as **“All the birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth the sun.”**. According to Fischer, the entire corpus (some 85% of it) was composed of similar **procreative sequences**, essentially a mythic narrative told in a highly repetitive, formulaic style. He even connected this to Thomson’s recorded chant *Atua Matariri*, noting that its verses have a comparable structure (“X \[by] copulating with Y produced Z”). Fischer’s bold claim made headlines – if true, it meant rongorongo’s content was mostly **cosmogonic myths** or genealogies of gods, a bit like Polynesian “genealogical chants” of creation. However, virtually all other rongorongo researchers **remain unconvinced by Fischer’s decipherment**. Several potent criticisms were raised (summarized by researcher Andrew Robinson and by Konstantin Pozdniakov, among others):

* Fischer’s triadic pattern (X–76–Y Z) does not hold up consistently. When the staff glyphs are scrutinized, barely half the sections fit the neat “3 glyphs with 76 on the first” rule – many sections have extra glyphs or missing 76’s, and glyph 76 sometimes appears where it shouldn’t if it were a rigid syntactic marker. Outside of the staff, the supposed pattern is even rarer; it’s not a pervasive key to all tablets.

* His specific interpretation requires linguistic leaps that are questionable. For instance, he treated a *hand* element on glyph 606 as a homophone for a plural word (*mau* in Tahitian) – but **Rapa Nui doesn’t use** *mau* as a plural in that way (and even if it did, the position is wrong for it to mean “all”). Similarly, he saw the fish glyph as literal “fish” in one instance, but elsewhere as a metaphorical womb or as “victim”, seemingly adjusting meanings to fit the desired translation.

* The **mythical scenario** Fischer proposes (birds mating with a fish to create the sun) is not attested in Polynesian mythology. He pointed to a verse in Ure’s chant about “Land copulated with Fish… produced the Sun,” but that was based on Salmon’s flawed translation; the corrected version by Métraux mentions nothing about birds or fish – it speaks of possibly the moon and darkness producing the sun. In short, Fischer’s reading relies on a misinterpreted oral text.

* Perhaps most damning, if one applies Fischer’s decipherment to the portion of text that Butinov and Knorozov thought was a genealogy, it leads to nonsensical outcomes: various animals and people would be copulating in impossible combinations, sometimes giving birth to themselves. This chaotic result undermines the internal consistency of his theory.

In light of these issues, Fischer’s “solution” is generally regarded as an overreach – an imaginative hypothesis that doesn’t reliably decipher new or existing texts. It did, however, draw attention to the possibility of *phonetic* elements in rongorongo (if indeed glyph components can represent sounds as Fischer attempted). But without broader acceptance, Fischer’s work remains one of many unverified interpretations.

The **current prevailing view** among experts is one of cautious skepticism: many lean toward rongorongo being a form of **proto-writing or mnemonic notation** rather than a direct encoding of speech. If it functioned like a mnemonic, each glyph or sequence might stand for a whole phrase or concept that a trained chanter would expand upon – meaning decipherment in the strict sense (recovering a verbatim text) could be impossible if you weren’t already taught the content. It is sobering that **three major hurdles** hinder any decipherment attempt:

1. **Limited corpus:** With only \~15,000 characters known, statistically it’s very hard to detect patterns and confirm hypotheses (for comparison, deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs or Linear B had far more text to work with). Many tablets are also weathered or fragmentary, further reducing usable data.

2. **Lack of bilingual texts or context:** We have no “Rosetta Stone” bilingual inscription for rongorongo, nor any illustrations or clear context for the texts (unlike Maya glyphs which often accompany pictures of what they describe). This means researchers must guess meaning only by internal structure and any tenuous links to known Rapa Nui lore.

3. **Obscure underlying language:** The language spoken on Easter Island in the era of rongorongo (let’s say 17th–18th century) is imperfectly known. Modern Rapa Nui has been heavily influenced by Tahitian and Spanish, losing some old vocabulary and forms. Additionally, if the tablets record specialized registers (e.g. ritual speech, genealogy terms), those words might not survive in any spoken form. So even if we suspect a glyph stands for a certain word, we might not know that word today.

Despite these challenges, research continues. A combination of **computerized analysis and cross-disciplinary study** offers hope for incremental progress. For example, Pozdniakov’s team used computational methods to refine glyph classification and find parallel sequences, which helped illuminate structural features of the script. Others have employed image enhancement (like 3D laser scanning and multispectral imaging) to read faded glyphs on weathered tablets, ensuring we at least have an accurate record of the corpus. Each new insight – whether it’s a statistical pattern, a linguistic clue, or an ethnographic parallel – adds a piece to the puzzle.

## Partial Insights and Ongoing Efforts

So, what *can* we read today in rongorongo, and how might a future “translator” work? At present, scholars have reliably **identified certain sequences or glyphs with meanings:**

* **The Lunar Calendar:** As discussed, a portion of the Mamari Tablet (Text C) encodes the sequence of nights in the Rapa Nui **lunisolar calendar**, including markers for when to insert intercalary nights. While we can’t phonetically read the glyphs, we can assign each one a specific night name (e.g. *Hiro*, *Kokore*, *Maure*, etc.) based on alignment with known month names. This section is the only place where rongorongo’s meaning is considered *deciphered* (albeit partially). A future translator program could, for instance, recognize this sequence and label it as “lunar calendar (month X)” in English.

* **Genealogical or List Markers:** The repeated use of glyph 76 (the suffix attached to many human or animal figures) is strongly suspected to mean something like **“offspring of”** or a grammatical genitive marker. Glyphs that frequently follow 76 could be personal names or lineage terms. Additionally, the fish glyph (700) appearing often at the end of phrases might mark a death or completion of a name (*ika* “victim”). A translator might flag sequences like “Person A 76 Person B 700” as something akin to “A, son of B (deceased)”. However, without knowing who “A” or “B” are (since we don’t have direct name lists), this remains a structural understanding, not a full translation.

* **Symbolic Pictographs:** A few glyphs seem to directly depict what they mean – essentially as logograms. For example, a crescent shape with a line likely denotes “moon” or a specific moon phase, a glyph of a paddle might mean “canoe” or “voyaging,” and certain bird glyphs could stand for “bird” or a deity associated with birds. These identifications come from visual resemblance combined with cultural context (Easter Island’s birdman cult, etc.), but caution is needed: a glyph that looks like a bird might sometimes be used phonetically or for a metaphor rather than literally “bird.” Nonetheless, a translator tool might incorporate a library of plausible meanings for each glyph based on prior research (e.g., glyph 380, a figure with a beak, possibly represents a bird or god **Makemake**, the chief deity often depicted as a bird-man).

* **Repetitive Formulae:** If we accept Pozdniakov’s finding that many tablets share common phrases, one could imagine that those phrases correspond to refrains or standard lines in chants. For instance, a phrase that appears a dozen times across tablets might translate to a ritual greeting or invocation. As of now, we can spot the repetition but not the precise meaning. Any translator might label such a phrase as “\[repeated formula, possibly meaning X]” with a footnote.

Importantly, **no complete “bilingual text” or direct key has emerged** to allow a straightforward decoding of rongorongo into English (or modern Rapa Nui). Any present-day attempt at a bidirectional translator would be largely speculative, relying on patterns and educated guesses. It would likely produce a rough outline or keywords of what a tablet might be about (e.g. “This text appears to list lineage names or a hymn about creation”) rather than a literal sentence-by-sentence translation. That said, the ongoing correlation of glyphs with Rapa Nui’s lexicon and lore could expand a lexicon of possible glyph values. For example, if one tablet is suspected to contain the **royal genealogy of Easter Island’s kings**, and we have those king names from oral history, a cryptanalyst might try to match name lengths or repeats in the glyph sequence to that known list. If a convincing alignment is found (say a glyph sequence recurring as often as a well-known king’s name should), that could assign a phonetic reading to those glyphs. Such a breakthrough has not yet occurred to consensus satisfaction, but future discoveries (or perhaps machine learning applied to the corpus and comparative Polynesian texts) might reveal patterns humans have missed.

In recent years, a multidisciplinary team led by linguist **Silvia Ferrara** has been systematically re-examining rongorongo. Their project, *INSCRIBE*, combines traditional epigraphy with computer modeling. As noted earlier, Ferrara’s team confirmed the **pre-contact age** of the script via radiocarbon dating and is exploring the idea that rongorongo might have begun as a **memory aid device** that became increasingly standardized over time. They stress that if rongorongo is indeed an independent invention of writing (or near-writing), it might not map neatly onto spoken language like alphabets do, but could encode information in a more conceptual way. This perspective influences decipherment attempts: rather than expecting full grammatical sentences, researchers look for **recurring semantic clusters** (like lists of names, sequences of celestial events, genealogical “X son of Y” constructs, etc.) which can be validated against known cultural data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, investigating and correlating rongorongo symbols with past research and Rapa Nui’s cultural context has yielded **incremental progress** in understanding this enigmatic script. By cross-referencing the glyphs with the island’s **oral traditions, mythology, and language**, scholars have identified a lunar calendar in the inscriptions, plausible genealogies of chiefs or gods, and specific symbols with culturally grounded meanings. Each academic source – from Barthel’s corpus and Métraux’s ethnographic notes to Pozdniakov’s computational analyses – adds a layer of insight that can be built upon. While a full decipherment remains elusive in 2025, the path forward lies in synthesizing these approaches: continuing the meticulous comparison of all confirmed rongorongo texts, applying modern decoding algorithms, and **leveraging every clue from Polynesian lore and Old Rapa Nui language** to make educated correlations. Any attempt to create a “bidirectional translator” for English↔Rongorongo must acknowledge the script’s undeciphered status and likely ideographic nature. In practice, such a translator would function more as a dictionary of known or proposed glyph meanings and patterns, rather than a Google-translate style converter. Nevertheless, as our knowledge grows, it may become possible to **“read” rongorongo in broad strokes** – identifying a tablet as, say, a prayer to the moon goddess, a genealogy of high chiefs, or a chant about creation – even if we may never recover a verbatim phonetic reading of each line. The mystery of rongorongo endures, but with each interdisciplinary investigation, we chip away a little more at its secrets, bringing us closer to the voices of Easter Island’s past preserved in those elegant lines of glyphs.
