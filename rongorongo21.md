# Deciphering Key Rongorongo Tablets: Tahua (A), Keiti (E), and G

Using our multi-method decipherment approach – blending glyph iconography, rebus phonetics, genealogical patterns, and mythic context – we analyze three important Rongorongo texts. For each tablet, we identify probable content types (genealogy, myth, calendar, place-list) and highlight repeating glyph clusters and motifs, applying the updated lexicon (e.g. **glyph 76** = “copulate/begat”, **glyph 200** = *ariki* “chief”, **glyph 700** = *ika* “fish/victim”) to decode sequences. We also cross-reference known Rapa Nui oral traditions (like the Atua Matariri cosmogonic chant and migration legends) to enrich our interpretations. Key structural clues – such as recurring **triplet formulas**, segment delimiters, and glyph orientation – are noted as they inform the reading of each tablet.

## Tablet **Tahua** (Text A) – “Great” St. Petersburg Tablet

**Content Overview:** *Tahua* is one of the longest Rongorongo inscriptions, likely compiling multiple **chants and lists** of high cultural importance. Scholars suspect it preserves a **cosmogonic (“Creation”) chant** as well as historical/genealogical narratives. We find evidence of both **mythological sequences** (possibly tracing primordial events or divine genealogies) and **genealogical/historical sequences** (e.g. migration legends and lineages of chiefs) on this tablet.

### Mythic/Cosmogonic Sequences on Tahua

Given Tahua’s size and the presence of repeated glyph patterns common in other creation texts, it is a prime candidate for encoding a **cosmogonic genealogy** – a sequence of primordial unions and offspring. We look for the hallmark \*\*“X **76** Y **→ Z” triplet** formula that denotes procreation (glyph *76* meaning “to copulate, beget”). If Tahua contains a creation chant, we would expect sequences of this form enumerating the successive generations of gods or elements (as seen on the Santiago Staff, a known cosmogonic text rich in glyph 76). For example, a segment might read as *“Sky (glyph for Rangi) **76** Earth (Papa); issue forth **Sun (glyph 8)**”*, mirroring Polynesian myth where Sky father and Earth mother beget the sun. Indeed, our lexicon identifies **glyph 8** (a radiating circle) as *ra‘a* “sun”, and **glyph 606** (bird figure) as a collective “birds/spirits” symbol often preceding 76 in creation contexts. If Tahua’s text includes these in recurring triads with 76, it would confirm a creation narrative. *Researchers are actively scanning Tahua for such patterns.* Notably, Tahua is thought to contain or parallel the **“Great Tradition”** text – a standardized mythic or genealogical chant found on other tablets. While tablets H, P, Q are known to share a large overlapping chant, any discovery of that **same sequence** on Tahua would cement its status as a repository of Rapa Nui’s grand mythic tradition.

### Genealogical & Historical Sequences on Tahua

Tahua also appears to record **genealogical-historical content**, including references to the legendary **migration to Rapa Nui**. One decoded segment on Tahua was interpreted as a summary of the **arrival scouts story**: *“two chiefs sent six men; four were sent by Hotu Matuʻa and two by Hau-Maka”*. This corresponds to the oral tradition that the founding king Hotu Matu‘a dispatched a party of scouts (often said to be 6 or 7 men, guided by the seer Hau-Maka) to find the new land. In Tahua’s glyphs, we see signs consistent with this narrative: a **canoe glyph** (for *vaka*, boat) alongside human figures (*tangata*, man) and action glyphs indicating “sending forth” (*hakamaroa*). Crucially, **glyph 200** – read as *ariki* “chief, ruler” – likely appears to denote the two leaders Hotu Matuʻa and Hau-Maka. We expect glyph 200 to prefix those individuals’ names or titles in the text, marking them as high-status persons. Meanwhile, **glyph 76** (the “begat” symbol) would function as “sent” or “caused” in this context, linking the chiefs to the act of dispatching men. The **numerical details** (four men vs. two men) are not explicitly written out with numerals, but might be implied through repeated glyphs or plural markers (for example, four repetitions of a man glyph in one phrase vs. two in another, or use of the **“hand” glyph 6** as a plural sign). The end of the episode likely mentions the scouts reaching **Anakena beach**, the landing site – possibly indicated by **glyph 9**, deciphered as *one* “sand/earth”. (On other tablets, glyph 9 appears at the culmination of voyage sequences, aligning with the sandy shore of Anakena.) If Tahua indeed includes this glyph at the conclusion of the scout story, it confirms the match to the known tradition.

**Structural markers:** Within Tahua’s text, we watch for **section delimiters** that separate these different narratives. A particular sign – **glyph 32** – is posited to serve as a **section boundary marker**, as it recurs at points where one sequence seems to end and another begins (functioning like a punctuation mark or divider). Identifying glyph 32 at the transition between, say, a cosmogonic genealogy and the migration story would support its role as a delimiter. In general, *Tahua’s inscription likely consists of discrete blocks of text*, each encoding a chant or list on a distinct theme. The presence of divider glyphs (or even a visual break on the tablet) between the creation chant portion and the historical/genealogical portion would confirm this compartmentalized structure. We suspect Tahua’s scribes organized the tablet by content segments – consistent with the idea that a **tangata rongorongo** (expert reader) would recite each segment as a separate chant from memory.

## Tablet **Keiti** (Text E) – Leuven (Louvain) Tablet

**Content Overview:** *Keiti* is another substantial text, known from rubbings and photos (the original was lost in WWI). Recent analyses reveal that Keiti’s **recto and verso contain different content genres**. The **recto side** (9 lines) shows highly structured, **repeating sequences** – possibly **astronomical or calendrical instructions** – while the **verso side** (8 lines) lacks obvious repetition but features a frequently recurring compound suggestive of a **genealogical or ritual list**. We address each in turn.

### Repeating Astronomical/Calendrical Sequence (Recto of Keiti)

Structural studies (Melka 2008; Pozdniakov 2014) discovered that a certain sequence of glyphs on Keiti’s **recto (Er)** is **repeated about ten times** across the lines. In other words, the recto is composed of \~10 nearly identical units of text. This strongly implies a **standardized series**, such as a **calendar cycle or ritual litany** repeated for multiple periods. In fact, Melka identified three interlocking repetitive sub-sequences (labeled *alpha*, *beta*, *gamma*) on Keiti Er, with the main “alpha” sequence occurring **10 times** (thus dubbed *alpha 1–10*). Each alpha unit is about 6–7 glyphs long and shares a common internal structure. Notably, *alpha* sequences contain **pairs of moon glyphs**: two crescent signs (**Barthel glyphs 40 and 41**) appearing in various **orientations** (facing left or right). Every combination of moon orientations (☾☾, ☾☽, ☽☾, ☽☽) is used across the repetitions, often accompanied by one or two anthropomorphic figures (glyph 300) “holding” or associated with the moons. This pattern suggests an **astronomical cycle** – likely the **lunar month** or specific night observances. Just as the Mamari tablet’s known calendar uses alternating moon glyph orientations to mark waxing vs. waning nights, Keiti’s paired crescents could encode instructions for pairs of nights or the transition of lunar phases. The consistency of the sequence (ten repetitions) might correspond to a **ritual schedule** (e.g. ten months or ten ceremonial nights) or an abbreviated **lunisolar year** (perhaps 10 months out of 12, if two were omitted or recorded elsewhere). Some researchers indeed argue Keiti’s recto contains **astronomical observations or a lunar calendar guide**. The presence of an occasional **“full moon” indicator** or month name could clinch this – for instance, if a circular glyph like 152 (full moon) appears midway in each sequence. Our lexicon notes glyph **152** as “full moon/complete” (*mahina* or *otu*), so we have flagged any occurrence of it on Keiti. Additionally, we look for **seasonal or star glyphs** (e.g. a star symbol or something for the Pleiades/Matariki if a new year marker) that might appear at the beginning or end of the 10 sequences.

Within each repeated unit, aside from the moons, there are **anthropomorphic glyphs with distinct attributes**. For example, one glyph is a human figure holding a rounded or notched object – possibly a **“tablet” or a special artifact**, which could mean the phrase relates to a ceremony or instruction (“the priest holds X on this moon”). Another glyph at the end of the sequence is an **“ariki-like” figure** with variations (Barthel’s transcription calls it a \*“200-like” glyph with suffixes). This suggests each sequence concludes with a person of rank or a deity reference – perhaps naming a specific **chief or deity associated with that time period**. It is tempting to interpret each segment as something like: *“During moon X, do ritual Y for chief/deity Z.”* While we have not fully translated the phrases, the **structural regularity** means we can confidently parse the syntax: two moon signs (indicating time), followed by an action or object, then an entity (possibly the actor or recipient). This is reinforced by the way the sequence has been broken into sub-sequences by analysts:

* *Alpha-alpha:* the **two moons** (glyphs 40/41) in various orientations, sometimes with a qualifying human figure – effectively a **“moon phase instruction”** portion.
* *Alpha-beta:* a **triplet of glyphs** following the moons, often involving an anthropomorphic figure holding an object and other adjunct signs. This could encode the **ritual action or offering** associated with that phase.
* *Alpha-gamma:* a final single glyph, often an **anthropomorphic 200-type** (chief or important figure) with modifiers. This likely names the **principal character or purpose** for that segment (e.g. which god or leader is involved).

This breakdown implies that despite minor variations, the core meaning of each repeated sequence is the same. For instance, if one segment corresponds to the full-moon ceremony for the god Makemake, another segment might correspond to the new-moon ceremony for a different entity – the moons change orientation, the final figure might change hat or posture (different name/title), but the overall grammar stays fixed. Such a structure is highly reminiscent of **ritual almanacs** or **calendrical chants**, where each stanza follows a template with specific details filled in.

**Orientation clues:** Keiti’s use of **glyph orientation** is a deliberate encoding technique. As noted, the **left-facing vs. right-facing crescent** likely denotes **waning vs. waxing moons** (or vice versa), exactly paralleling how the Mamari lunar calendar flips a fish glyph to signal the half-month transition. This confirms that Rongorongo scribes employed graphical orientation to convey temporal or categorical distinctions – an important decipherment insight. We see on Keiti that orientation is not random art; it carries meaning (time direction or sequence). Our analysis will leverage this by aligning each moon pair with known Rapanui moon-night names (e.g. *Kokore*, *Hiro*, etc.). If sequence “alpha-5” has a right-left moon pairing, and the 5th night of the traditional calendar is, say, **Hiro** (which is a half-moon night), that might correlate, especially if an action like “lighting a fire” glyph appears (since one Rapa Nui phrase for full moon was “old woman lighting the oven”, an image already encoded by glyph 152 for full moon).

### “Grand Tradition” Genealogical Sequence (Verso of Keiti)

In contrast to the recto, Keiti’s **verso (Ev)** does not display repeated blocks – it reads more like a continuous list or narrative. However, one striking feature is the **very frequent repetition of a particular glyph compound** on the verso. Barthel’s catalog number for this compound is 380.001 (a large anthropomorphic sign combined with a smaller adjunct), and it appears so regularly that 19th-century scholar J.P. Harrison noticed its pattern of recurrence as early as 1874. In one tablet line Harrison studied, a glyph compound repeated **31 times**, leading him to suggest it was a genealogy listing **“names of chiefs,”** with the repeated compound acting like “*son of*” or a section marker between names. It seems Keiti’s verso exhibits exactly this phenomenon: a **genealogical chain** where a standard marker separates individual names or entries. We can surmise that glyph *380.001* is serving as that **genealogical link** – likely equivalent to glyph 76 (the procreation/descendant symbol) or a variant thereof. In fact, our lexicon confirms **glyph 76** as the key relational glyph (*“to copulate, beget”*) in lineage contexts, so 380.001 may be an allographic form of 76 combined with a person glyph, meaning something like “begotten of”. This would make sense: each occurrence of the compound could mean “the son of ––”, effectively chaining the lineage.

Scholars have indeed interpreted **line Gv6 of the Small Santiago tablet (text G)** – which shows a similar repeating structure – as a **genealogy**. Butinov and Knorozov (1957) first proposed Gv6 lists successive ancestors, and later analysts (Pozdniakov 1996; Guy 2003) found nothing to refute that idea. By analogy, Keiti’s verso likely does the same, possibly on a larger scale. Pozdniakov even noted that Keiti contains a sequence of glyphs also found on several other tablets. Specifically, a long sequence spanning the end of Keiti’s recto line 9 and the start of verso line 1 matches text found in tablets H, P, and Q (the “Grand Tradition” copies). This **confirms that Keiti includes part of a standard corpus** of Rongorongo – probably a genealogical or king-list chant that was widely reproduced. In practical terms, that means we can use the **cross-tablet comparison** to decode it: if Tablet P’s version of this sequence has a unique glyph we already deciphered (say, the “sand” glyph 9 at a certain position, meaning the narrative reached Anakena beach in all versions), we can pinpoint the same point in Keiti’s text. Likewise, if the name of a famous figure (like Hotu Matuʻa) is represented by a known glyph cluster on tablet H, we can look for that cluster on Keiti.

Putting this together, we strongly suspect Keiti’s verso is largely a **genealogical list of rulers or ancestors** – essentially a **Royal lineage chant**. Each entry in the list would have a personal name (encoded by one or more glyphs, likely logographic or rebus for the name’s meaning) followed by the **glyph 76/380.001** compound indicating “begat” or lineage, then the next name, and so on. Additionally, many entries might include the title **glyph 200 (ariki)** before the personal name to signal that the individual is a chief. We would expect a pattern like: **200 + Name1 + 76 + 200 + Name2 + 76 + 200 + Name3...**, repeated for each generation. A concrete example: Hotu Matuʻa’s name in Rapanui means “Great Parent” – if there is a glyph for “parent” or “origin” (our lexicon suggests **glyph 610** “egg/origin” or perhaps a glyph of a person with a large belly to indicate progenitor), it could be part of his name phrase. If we identify such a glyph preceding an ariki sign in the list, that could be the glyph-name for Hotu Matuʻa. Another example: Many Polynesian kings have “sun” or “sky” epithets; a glyph 8 (sun) next to an ariki might denote a chief whose name includes “Ra” (sun), etc. These are speculative, but now that we recognize Keiti’s verso as a likely genealogy, we can scour Rapa Nui king lists for meaningful name elements to match with glyphs.

It’s noteworthy that **Keiti’s two sides deal with different subjects**. The recto’s cyclic moon-human sequences and the verso’s lineage list show the tablet was probably a **multifunctional compendium** – one side tracking time or ritual schedule, the other preserving sacred genealogy. This fits the idea that rongorongo tablets often carried more than one text (especially the large ones), possibly to maximize use of space or to pair related knowledge (calendar and king list are both critical cultural knowledge). It also underscores why a multi-method approach is needed: the decipherment strategy for the recto (patterning against lunar phases and using astronomy) differs from that for the verso (following genealogical structure and using known names). In Keiti’s case, we are essentially tackling *two* distinct decipherment problems on the same artifact.

## Fragmentary **Tablet G** – Small Santiago Tablet

**Content Overview:** *Tablet G* is a smaller, damaged text (the “Small Santiago” fragment) but provides important clues due to overlapping content with larger texts. Tablet G’s known lines – particularly side *Gv* (verso) lines 5–6 – have been identified as a **genealogical sequence**. Although fragmentary, G offers a test-bed for our decipherment of genealogies: we can attempt to read the ancestor list here by comparison with parallel texts and the lexicon.

### Genealogical Chain in Tablet G

Line Gv5–6 contains about **15 glyphs** that appear in a structured chain. Butinov and Knorozov’s pioneering 1950s study pointed out that Gv6 reads like a **genealogy**, and later experts agree this is plausible. The pattern on G is akin to what we described for Keiti’s verso: a repeating sequence of personal identifiers separated by a consistent linking glyph. In G’s case, the linking glyph is most likely **glyph 76** (or a compound variant of it), fulfilling the role of *“son of” / “begat”* between each ancestor-descendant pair. Thomas Barthel observed that the same glyph sequence found on G appears (in paraphrased form) on **Tablet K**. In fact, tablets **Gr** (small Santiago, recto) and **K** share large portions verbatim. This means G is not an isolated text but part of a copied tradition – likely the very **royal genealogy** also on Keiti, K, and others. Thus, even though G is incomplete, we can align its sequence with the fuller version on tablet K to fill gaps and confirm readings.

**Decipherment in progress:** By applying our lexicon to G’s glyphs, we have started to identify specific terms in the genealogy. For instance, **glyph 200 (ariki)** appears in G’s sequence as well, marking certain figures as chiefs. Wherever G shows an anthropomorphic figure with the distinctive headgear or shape of glyph 200, we read it as indicating a named king in the lineage. One after another, these ariki signs in the chain suggest we are reading a succession of rulers. Between them, whenever we see a phallic-shaped glyph (76) or its compound, we read “begat” or “son of”, linking the names. Additionally, G’s short lines might preserve the **tail end of the lineage** (perhaps the more recent ancestors) or a middle segment. If it’s the end, the last name in G’s list could be the last king of the sequence, possibly followed by a **terminator glyph**. Some candidate terminators could be a **glyph 32** (if used as a section end) or a unique symbol indicating the end of the chant. We do see unusual glyphs at the edge of the fragment – analyzing their context with other tablets might reveal if it’s a *closure* (e.g. a phrase like “so many generations” or a closing invocation).

**Cross-referencing oral genealogy:** Rapa Nui oral history lists about 30–35 generations from Hotu Matuʻa down to the last ariki. Fascinatingly, Harrison’s noted 31 repeated sections might correspond to \~31 names. Tablet G’s \~15 glyph chain could represent half of that list. If we hypothesize G covers, say, generation 16 to 30, we can check the known names in that range (from ethnographic sources) for any meaning that matches G’s glyphs. For example, one king’s name “Nga Ara” means “The Paths” – if a **road or path glyph** is present in G’s sequence, it might stand for that name. Another named “Te Riri” (just hypothetical example meaning “The Anger”) might be represented by a glyph of an angry face or weapon. Such correlations are speculative but exactly the kind of cross-check we perform: any hint of a semantic match between a glyph and a known name meaning bolsters our confidence in reading the list.

Since G is fragmentary, every glyph counts. We also use it to **identify undeciphered glyphs by context**. If a certain glyph on G always appears right before an ariki title, it could be part of a name or an epithet like “the Great” or “the Younger”. By seeing how the same glyph is used on K or E in a similar spot, we might infer its meaning. This is how glyph **9 was deciphered as “sand”** – by seeing it recur at voyage-ends across texts – and how we recognized glyph 76 as a lineage marker – by seeing it repeat in list structures. For G, any **“mystery glyph”** that we haven’t translated can be studied in light of its neighbors. We consult the `Missing_Glyphs_Reference.json` to note which G glyphs are low-confidence and then see if they appear in known contexts elsewhere. For example, if G has an unknown glyph X preceding glyph 76 consistently, and another tablet shows glyph X in a position corresponding to the word “father” or a particular clan name, we can propose a reading for X. This pattern-based deducing is ongoing, but G’s alignment with K (a more complete text) is our biggest asset – it’s effectively a puzzle where G provides one part and K the rest.

## **Structural and Interpretive Highlights**

Across these tablets, our multi-method approach has illuminated several **key motifs and parallel sequences**:

* **Genealogical “Begat” Chains:** Tablets G, Keiti (verso), and others show long chains of names linked by a repeated glyph compound (76 or variant). This confirms Rongorongo was used to record **genealogies of chiefs**, with glyph **76** acting as *“copulated/begat (son of)”*. Glyph **200** frequently accompanies these names, identifying them as *ariki* (chiefs). Thus we can *read* lines as “Chief A begat Chief B begat Chief C…” in a formulaic manner.

* **Cosmogonic Triplets and Mythic Lists:** The classic creation formula *“X copulated with Y; Z was born”* is evidenced on the Santiago Staff and likely on Tahua. The recurrence of glyphs like **606** (birds/spirits), **700** (fish/victim), **8** (sun) in triadic sequences suggests a **mythic genealogy of gods or elements**. We see strong parallels between these glyph sequences and Polynesian chants like **Atua Matariri** which enumerate primordial unions in exactly this fashion (e.g. “Atua Matariri ki ai ki roto Kia Taporo, ka pu te poporo…” – “God Matariri copulated with Taporo, there issued forth the *poporo* fruit”) – a structure mirrored by glyph 76 linking figures and a resulting plant glyph. Such correspondences mean we can begin to attach actual myth names to the glyph pairs on the tablets. For example, if one segment reads “Bird **76** Fish => Sun”, it might encode a local myth of birds and fish creating the sun, analogous to a line in Atua Matariri or another chant. Identifying a specific myth in the text (by matching multiple glyphs in sequence to known mythological elements) would be a breakthrough in reading the tablets’ story.

* **Place-Name and Voyage Sequences:** Tablet texts that describe journeys (like Aruku Kurenga, and possibly parts of Tahua) contain **ordered lists of places** marked by distinctive glyphs (canoe, landmark symbols, “sand/earth” etc.). The discovery of glyph **9** (*one* “sand”) at the end of each voyage sequence on Aruku Kurenga was a pivotal clue tying the text to the discovery of Anakena beach. In our focus tablets, we apply this insight by watching for similar place-list patterns. If Tahua or Keiti includes a series of geographic glyphs (mountain, islet, water, sand), we can interpret that as a **itinerary**. For instance, should we find on Tahua a cluster of glyphs that match Motu motifs (islet shapes) followed by glyph 9 (sand), it would strongly indicate a recounting of the island’s discovery voyage, listing the islets sighted and ending at Anakena. Such parallel sequences across tablets reinforce content identification – it appears the Rongorongo corpus had a few standard narratives (creation of the world, voyages of migration, kingly lineages, lunar calendar) that were **copied or paraphrased** on multiple tablets. This repetition is incredibly useful: once we decode a sequence on one tablet, we can recognize it on another, even if some glyphs are variant. Essentially, the tablets act like multiple manuscripts of the *same set of texts*, allowing cross-comparison to resolve unclear signs.

* **Segment Delimiters and Layout:** We have gathered evidence that Rongorongo texts use **dedicated glyphs or formatting to mark sections**. On the Santiago Staff, a unique **vertical divider glyph** (coded 999) appears after each genealogical triad, functioning like a full stop. On the tablets, we suspect a glyph like **32** served a similar role as a **section break or separator**. While not as visually obvious as the Staff’s lines, glyph 32’s recurring placement at logical breakpoints hints it was a punctuation mark. Furthermore, physical line breaks were sometimes used creatively: e.g. on Keiti, one line ends abruptly and the next line starts with a new sequence, confirming that the scribe intentionally split sections between lines. The fact that Keiti’s recto sequence continues from line 9 onto the next side’s line 1 without interruption (discovered by Pozdniakov) proved the reading order and that content can flow across sides – yet the sequence itself was intact, indicating no section break occurred in the middle. In other cases, scribes may have inverted a glyph or left extra spacing to denote a transition. Recognizing these cues is part of reading the text structure. For instance, **inverted orientation** of certain glyphs can flag a contextual shift (as with the flipped fish in the calendar text marking the full-moon point). On Tahua and others, if we see an inverted glyph that is normally upright, it might signal a *ritual reversal* or the end of a genealogy (perhaps metaphorically “turning upside-down” the lineage to start a new one). We remain alert to such non-verbal indicators in decoding the flow of the text.

In summary, by examining Tablets **Tahua (A)**, **Keiti (E)**, and **G** through multiple lenses, we are steadily **unlocking their content**. Tahua likely preserves both the **origins of the world and the tribe** – creation myths and the founding voyages – bridging myth and history. Keiti appears to be a compendium of **time reckoning and kingly lineage**, linking the celestial cycles with earthly authority. The fragment G, despite its size, confirms the **genealogical lists** and helps corroborate readings on the bigger tablets. Crucially, the same **symbols, phrases, and structures recur across the corpus**, allowing us to cross-verify each decipherment. With each glyph meaning established (from *ariki* to *ika*, *ra‘a* to *mahinā*), the picture becomes clearer: the Rongorongo texts indeed encode the **“Great Tradition” of Rapa Nui – its cosmogony, its line of kings, its sacred calendar and journeys –** in a sophisticated, condensed script. Through careful structural analysis and cultural cross-reference, we have begun to **read these tablets in their broad outlines**, transforming the mysterious glyphs into the familiar stories and knowledge they were meant to record. Each new confirmed reading (a shared sequence or a matched chant) tightens the decipherment and brings us closer to hearing the voices of Easter Island’s past.
