## Deciphering the Santiago Staff (Rongorongo Text I): A Multi-Layered Analysis

## Recurring Glyph Sequences with Glyph 76 (Procreation Formula)

One of the most striking features of the Santiago Staff text is the extreme frequency of **glyph 76**, a phallic-shaped sign associated with sexual union. Glyph 76 appears **\~564 times** on the staff, often in repetitive sequences suggesting a formula. These sequences typically consist of a **triplet**: **X – 76 – Y**, sometimes followed by a resultant glyph Z, and are separated by vertical divider marks (see Section on segment boundaries). In Fischer’s interpretation, each such segment encodes a phrase *“X copulated with Y; there issued forth Z.”*. For example, one frequently cited sequence on the Staff is **“606.76 700 8”**, which Fischer reads as *“all the birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth the sun.”*. Here **606** (a composite bird glyph) acts as subject “birds”, **76** is the copulation act, **700** is the object “fish”, and **8** is the offspring “sun”. This formula appears to repeat with varying participants, indicating a **generational or cosmogonic list** composed of many such procreative events. Notably, glyph 76 tends to occur at regular intervals – in fact *“nearly every third glyph displays a phallus”* on the Staff, reflecting its role in a recurring triadic formula. We will explore how these repeating patterns potentially map to mythological “X begat Y” sequences in Rapa Nui lore.

## Phonetic and Rebus Hypotheses for Glyph Clusters

To interpret these glyph clusters, researchers have applied **phonetic and rebus-based reasoning**, leveraging Polynesian language knowledge and glyph shape clues. In some cases the glyph’s form suggests its meaning or sound (rebus principle); in others, repetition and position hint at grammatical uses. **Glyph 76** is a clear example: its phallic shape led Barthel to identify it as a “phallus” symbol, which Fischer took as the verb *“to copulate”*. In Rapa Nui language, a common word for sexual intercourse is **`‘ai`** (also meaning “to copulate” euphemistically), and indeed the lexicon suggests transliterations of glyph 76 as *“ai”* (“copulate/sex”) with high confidence. Another possibility given is **`fanau`** (to procreate, to bear children), reflecting the generative context of this glyph. Thus, glyph 76 likely functions as a **verb** indicating the act of procreation.

Other glyphs in the sequence seem to denote **nouns (subjects or objects)**, often by pictorial resemblance or established Rongorongo values. For instance, **glyph 700** depicts a fish and is interpreted as *“fish”* (Rapanui *ika*). Interestingly, in Rapa Nui usage *ika* “fish” could metaphorically mean a war victim, and indeed scholars like Guy note that the “fish” glyph might also mean *“victim/sacrifice”* in some contexts. On the Staff, however, within a cosmogonic reading, 700 is read plainly as *ika* “fish” – one half of a primal pairing. **Glyph 606** is a composite sign appearing frequently before 76; it seems to be a doubled or plural form of a bird glyph. The dataset transliterates 606 as *“puhi manu”* meaning “flock of birds” or “birds (collectively)”, derived from *manu* (bird) in Rapanui. Its inclusion as a subject in the example segment (606.76…) suggests it signifies “all birds” engaging in the creative act. In general, **doubling of a sign** (as in a bird + bird combination) is thought to pluralize or intensify the concept, a common Polynesian linguistic device (cf. reduplication in Polynesian languages to indicate plurality or emphasis).

Rebus-based interpretations have also been proposed for more abstract concepts. For example, **glyph 6** (a hand/arm) can signify the verb “to take” (*ma’u* in Rapanui) or act as a plural marker when attached to another glyph. This indicates that some sequences might encode syntax: a noun plus a *“plural”* or *collective* marker. Similarly, certain glyphs may have phonetic values derived from Rapanui homophones – e.g. a glyph shaped like an eye (*mata*) is used for “to see” (*kite*) because *mata* (eye) is conceptually linked to vision. In our context, however, the **X, 76, Y, Z** sequences seem largely **logographic** (using glyphs for whole words/concepts like “bird”, “fish”, “sun”) with glyph 76 functioning as a relational verb “to copulate”. The consistency of the formula across the text strengthens the idea that the script here is recording a **fixed phrase structure**, possibly a memorized chant, rather than phonetically spelling out sentences. Nevertheless, these interpretations of glyphs rely on Polynesian linguistic parallels (for example, Rapanui *ra‘a* for “sun” is a likely value for glyph **8**, which is drawn as a circular, radiating form – a visual rebus for the sun). We present a brief transliteration table of key glyphs from this sequence and their likely meanings:

*Table: Key glyphs from the Santiago Staff procreation sequences, with hypothesized readings and parallels in Rapa Nui.* Each pairing of **X and Y** joined by the copulation glyph *76* yields a subsequent **Z**, and then a divider **|** (glyph 999) typically follows, demarcating that segment.

## Mythological Genealogy and Cosmogony in the Text

The content suggested by these sequences – birds mating with fish to produce the sun, and similar pairings – immediately recalls **Polynesian cosmogonic genealogies**. Throughout Polynesia, creation chants and myths often enumerate primal beings and elemental unions. For example, in many traditions a Sky Father and Earth Mother (such as **Atea** and **Papa**, or **Rangi** and **Papa** in Māori) unite to produce offspring (sun, moon, stars, gods, etc.). We would expect a genuine cosmogonic text to mention such primordial entities or fundamental elements of the world. Could the Santiago Staff be encoding a Rapa Nui version of the creation myth?

Rapa Nui’s own mythology is not as well documented as Māori or Tahitian, but there are hints of similar concepts. Some 19th-century folklore texts contain chants of creation or procreation among personified elements. For instance, an ancient chant called **Atua Matariri** (recorded by Thomson from the Rapanui elder Ure) lists bizarre pairings of gods, animals, and natural phenomena begetting new creatures or elements. Notably, these chants do **not** strictly follow the classic Polynesian cosmic genealogy (they pair seemingly unrelated items – e.g. “Moon by mounting into Darkness, let Sun come forth”), yet they use a *formulaic structure* identical to that posited for the Staff. In Daniel Ure’s *Atua Matariri* chant, each verse is literally of the form **“X ki ‘ai ki roto Y, ka pū te Z”**, meaning *“X, by copulating inside Y, brought forth Z.”*. For example, one verse states: *“Land copulated with the fish (named Ruhi Paralyzer); there issued forth the Sun.”*. Another says: *“Moon, by mounting into Darkness, let Sun come forth.”*. These are remarkably similar to the Santiago Staff sequences in both syntax and content. It suggests that the Staff’s text could be a *cosmogonic litany* – a series of mythic unions creating new beings or cosmological elements, analogous to Rapa Nui creation chants. The presence of **celestial bodies** (sun, perhaps moon or stars) as outcomes in the Staff strengthens this interpretation (glyph 8 “sun” appears regularly as a result). We might anticipate other elemental subjects in the text as well – e.g. a glyph for “earth/land” or “sky” participating in an early segment. Indeed, if one segment on the Staff corresponds to “Land copulating with Fish -> Sun” as in Ure’s chant, it implies a glyph standing for “land” should be present (candidates could be glyph 30 *henua* “earth/land”【55†】 or perhaps glyph 50 *papa* “rock/foundation”【55†】, if those appear). Early segments of the Staff, which unfortunately are not definitively identified as the “beginning” of the text due to uncertainty in reading order, might contain such fundamental pairings.

It is also notable that Polynesian genealogical chants often enumerate generations of gods or chiefs in a chain (A begat B, B begat C, etc.). If the Staff is a cosmogony, it could potentially be read as a **chain of creation**: the output Z of one segment becoming an input in the next segment (though given the grammar of the text, it might not explicitly link them, relying on the sequential listing). Cross-referencing Rapa Nui myth, one might expect to see names or forms corresponding to deities like **Tane** (a Polynesian god of light/sky), **Hina** (moon goddess), etc., or important natural elements like **Po** (darkness/night) and **Ao** (light/day). Some parts of the Atua Matariri chant do include such concepts (Darkness, etc.). Without a full decipherment, we can only hypothesize which glyphs might match those entities. The Staff’s heavy use of animal glyphs (birds, fish) is intriguing – it could indicate a localized Rapa Nui twist where animals are totemic ancestors or metaphors for elements (for instance, in some Eastern Polynesian myths birds can personify sky or wind, fish can personify sea or fertility).

Another possibility raised by researchers is that the Staff, rather than a pure cosmogony of gods, might enumerate **mythical ancestors or chiefs** in a lineage form (especially if glyph 76 were a patronymic marker instead of literal copulation). However, the presence of cosmic elements like the sun, and the formula’s parallel in known creation chants, leans toward a **cosmic genealogy** reading. It’s plausible the Staff records a sacred **creation chant** that was memorized by Easter Island priests – possibly even a teaching tool to remember the order of creation or the composition of glyphs (as Jacques Guy hypothesized, the Atua Matariri chant might have also functioned mnemonically for how composite glyphs are formed, given its nonsensical literal meaning). In summary, our cross-referencing with Rapa Nui myth suggests the Staff text is encoding a **mythical genealogy of the world**, where each segment is akin to “X and Y begat Z,” gradually detailing the origin of major elements (sun, perhaps moon, stars, certain animals, and ultimately lineages of gods or legendary figures). In Polynesian cosmology, after the primal gods come natural phenomena and eventually human ancestors, so it will be fascinating to see if later segments of the Staff shift toward human figures or remain in the realm of nature.

## Formulaic Structure and Oral Tradition Comparisons

The *Santiago Staff* shows a strict formulaic structure remarkably similar to known oral literature, as discussed above. Each section appears to follow the grammatical pattern: **Subject – (copulative verb) – Object – (offspring/result)**. In the rongorongo script, this might be compressed to **X 76 Y Z**, with the understanding that “76” carries the meaning “copulated with (inside)” and the last term is the outcome. This is exactly analogous to lines in Rapanui chants: *“X ki ‘ai ki roto ki Y, ka pu te Z.”* The Staff’s **vertical separators** (glyph 999) mark each such phrase boundary, effectively serving the same role as line breaks in a chanted verse. There are **103 vertical bars** on the Staff, implying roughly that many discrete phrases or verses in the composition. This gives a sense of the chant’s length – over a hundred generational steps or creative acts. Such length is not unheard of in Polynesia; genealogical chants can be very lengthy (for instance, the Hawaiian *Kumulipo* creation chant has over 2000 lines detailing generations of gods and creatures). The Staff could be Rapa Nui’s counterpart in woodcarved form.

When we compare specific known formulas, the Staff’s content aligns with the structure but not necessarily the *specifics* of mainstream Polynesian myths. As Guy (1998/1999) pointed out, neither the Staff nor the Atua Matariri chant strictly match the classic Rangi/Papa cosmogeny. Instead, they feature almost surreal pairings (e.g. “killing mated with stingray begat shark” in Atua Matariri). This has led to creative theories – one being that these verses actually describe **the creation of composite glyphs** (as an educational device), by saying “component X combined with component Y yields glyph Z”. For example, the chant line “Stinging Fly, by mounting into Swarm, let Horsefly come forth” could metaphorically describe assembling parts of a complex character. While intriguing, this hypothesis remains unproven. The more straightforward view is that both the chant and the Staff text are **procreation genealogies** of figurative beings, possibly recited as part of Rapa Nui’s sacred knowledge. The repetitive, almost rhythmic recurrence of *ki ‘ai ki roto* ... *ka pu te ...* is exactly the kind of **parallelism and repetition** one expects in oral chants, aiding memorization and ceremonial recitation.

It’s worth noting that Steven Fischer, who championed the procreation chant decipherment, even extended this formula to other rongorongo texts. He suggested that some other tablets contained similar creation sequences “sans the phallus” (i.e. omitting glyph 76 but implying it). This claim is controversial – later analyses did not find convincing parallels outside the Staff when the phallic glyph was removed. It appears the Staff is unique or nearly so in the corpus for being dominated by this reproductive theme (83% of all known occurrences of glyph 76 in rongorongo are on the Staff). This suggests the Staff’s content was specialized – perhaps a specific chant or text not duplicated elsewhere. The strict formula also means the text is highly **structured**; any decipherment attempt must account for that rigidity. In our analysis, the alignment with the *Atua Matariri* verses provides a strong culturally-grounded template for reading the Staff: effectively, we are dealing with a series of **mythic “matrimonial” or “sexual” unions** linking different categories of beings. By comparing each segment of Text I with Polynesian oral literature, we can often find a **plausible analog or at least a consistent thematic interpretation**. For instance, a segment where a sky-associated glyph mates with an earth-associated glyph should yield something like a celestial offspring (paralleling Sky-Earth producing Sun, etc.). If we encounter a segment where two animal glyphs mate to produce a third animal, this might correspond to a folk explanation of species origin or a transformation myth. Polynesian myths sometimes personify animals as demigods, so this is not out of place.

In summary, the Staff’s formulaic sequences echo known Rapa Nui and wider Polynesian **chant formulas** closely in structure, though the exact content may reflect a localized myth or a mnemonic device. The next step in decipherment is to map as many glyph triplets as possible to known mythological “sentences” or at least logical combinations (for example, if one segment shows a *moon* glyph as a result, we might hypothesize the parents could be *sun* and *something else* or *sky* and *night*, etc., checking if corresponding glyphs are present). This structural approach, grounded in comparative mythology, significantly narrows the field of interpretation for each glyph and cluster.

## Segment Boundaries and Text Structure (Glyph 999 Dividers)

As mentioned, **glyph 999**, rendered on the Staff as a vertical stroke, appears to function as a **section divider** or “period” between the procreative statements. The Santiago Staff is unique in the corpus for containing these engraved divider lines in such abundance (over 100 of them). Visually, the vertical bars partition the continuous line of glyphs into bite-sized units. Almost all these units contain a small number of glyphs, often **three or four glyphs long** (which correlates with the X–76–Y–Z formula length). Researchers have observed that the staff’s text seems to be **modular**: “almost all divisions comprise multiples of three” glyphs, reinforcing that each segment likely encodes a triplet or a triple-part phrase. In Fischer’s interpretation, each segment corresponds to one verse of the creation chant, so each vertical bar indicates the end of a verse (the phrase “ka pu te Z” implied by the appearance of Z and the bar).

From a content perspective, if we treat each 999-separated segment as one **generation or event**, the staff reads as a **chronological or logical sequence** of creation events. We can attempt to label these segment boundaries with generation numbers (e.g., Segment 1 = first act of creation, Segment 2 = second act, etc.). Doing so reveals patterns: for instance, if a character (glyph) that was an offspring in one segment later appears as a parent in a subsequent segment, that suggests a genealogical progression. Detecting such patterns requires identifying identical glyphs across segments – a task aided by the repetition in the text. Some preliminary observations: glyph 8 (sun) appears as a *result* in at least a couple of segments (as evidenced by the example “sun” outcome above), but does the sun glyph also appear as a parent elsewhere? If not, perhaps the text culminates in the creation of the sun (a climax of the cosmogony). On the other hand, the bird glyph 606 appears multiple times, likely as a parent in more than one segment, which could indicate that “birds” were involved in several creative acts (or that 606 might stand for different bird species in different contexts). The dividers allow us to isolate these sequences and analyze them individually.

Using the dividers, one can also attempt an **alignment with external genealogies**: For instance, if Rapa Nui mythology says *“Earth and Sky begat Sea”* (hypothetically), one might search the transcription of the Staff for a segment that contains the candidate glyph for earth, glyph 76, glyph for sky, glyph for sea, all within one pair of bars. Indeed, Barthel’s published transcription (1958) and later updates by the CEIPP give the positions of bars and glyph counts per segment. By mapping those with our lexicon, we can mark likely breaks corresponding to known myth phrases. So far, our method identifies clear segment boundaries thanks to glyph 999, which greatly reduces ambiguity in reading order – we know these segments were meant to be read separately, not run-on. This segmentation is a strong argument that the Staff text is **list-like or liturgical**, rather than narrative prose. Each segment could stand alone as a line in a chant (perhaps to be recited with a pause at each bar).

In addition, the uniformity introduced by the dividers might hint at **meter or rhythm**. If nearly every segment is, say, 3 glyphs (X-76-Y) or 4 glyphs (X-76-Y-Z) long, the chant might have had a consistent meter (for example, 6 syllables per line if each glyph corresponds to a word like “X ki ‘ai – ki roto Y – ka pu Z” which in Rapanui has a repetitive syllabic pattern). Indeed, many Polynesian chants are metrical. The physical carving of a separator could indicate where a chanter would take a breath or where a ritual response might occur. In this way, analyzing the placement of glyph 999 offers insights into how the text might have been **performed or chanted ritually**.

From a multi-layer decipherment perspective, marking each segment with its boundaries allows us to annotate the staff text with **probable translations segment-by-segment**. For example:

* Segment 1: **\[glyph A] 76 \[glyph B] \[glyph C]** | → “A copulated with B; brought forth C”
* Segment 2: **\[glyph D] 76 \[glyph E] \[glyph F]** | → “D copulated with E; brought forth F”

…and so on, where each letter stands for an unknown entity. By consulting Rapa Nui myth, we fill in these letters (e.g., A = *Papa* (Earth), B = *Rangi/Atea* (Sky), C = perhaps *henua* (land) or some first offspring). Repeating entities across segments (say glyph C of segment 1 is the same as glyph D of segment 2) would let us link “C” in myth context. Such analysis is ongoing, but the systematic use of glyph 999 makes it a much more attainable puzzle, as we are essentially dealing with a list of 100 formulaic lines to decode with a combination of lexicon and mythological context.

## Cross-Referencing Glyph Interpretations with the Dataset

Throughout this analysis, we have leveraged the provided **glyph-to-English lexicon and sign descriptions** to validate interpretations. This cross-reference acts as a consistency check: whenever we propose a reading for a glyph, we can see if it aligns with independent hypotheses in the dataset. Encouragingly, the core glyphs in the procreative sequence all have entries in the lexicon that support the creation theme:

* **Glyph 76** is confirmed as *“explicitly phallic… creation chants, sexual sequences”* with meanings “copulate, procreate, sex”. The sources credit Fischer 1997 and others, matching our use of 76 as “to copulate.”
* **Glyph 606** is described under base **600** as an *“avian form, creation lists”* (Barthel’s sign 600, likely a bird, noted to appear in creation contexts). The lexicon explicitly gives 606 as “birds, flock”, which fits our reading of it as “all the birds.”
* **Glyph 700** is listed as “fish (ika)” with a note as aquatic creature. Interestingly the lexicon also lists alternate readings (“victim” *kai*, “sacrifice” *haka ira*) for glyph 700, citing Knorozov’s ideas. This dual meaning is consistent with the debate: Fischer saw a literal fish (for a creation story), whereas others (Butinov, Knorozov, later Guy) thought the fish could be symbolic of victims in a war chronicle. Our current interpretation stays with “fish” in a cosmogonic sense, which is lexicon-supported.
* **Glyph 8** is clearly identified as “sun, star, fire, light” in both lexicon and sign list. The primary given transliteration is *ra‘a* (“sun”), which is exactly what we need for a creation myth (the birth of the sun). The lexicon notes that this interpretation comes from Bishop Jaussen’s informant Metoro (who in the 19th century chanted rongorongo texts aloud and gave some meanings), reinforcing that glyph 8 was seen as a celestial symbol historically.

Using the dataset, we also note some **supporting glyphs** that likely appear on the Staff in this context. For example, glyph **80** (breast, female, nurture) and glyph **90** (belly, pregnant) are identified as part of a “reproductive series”. If those glyphs occur alongside 76 in some segments, they might indicate specifically female or maternal roles in the genealogy (perhaps denoting mother goddesses or the state of pregnancy). Likewise, the sign list gives glyph **300** as “woman/mother (female anthropomorphic form, genealogical contexts)”, which could represent a primordial goddess like Papa or Hina if present. Glyph **500** is “ancestor/elder” and **200** is “chief/ariki/man” – these might come into play if later parts of the text list human ancestors or kings (e.g. perhaps transitioning into the royal lineage of the island, as some have speculated). At least one scholar (Butinov/Knorozov) thought the Staff was a genealogy of kings with 76 as a patronymic link “son of”. In that scenario, 76 would effectively mean “begat” rather than literal copulation, and the names of persons would fill X and Z. Interestingly, such an interpretation doesn’t contradict the structural findings – it would simply mean X and Y are personal names or titles rather than nature spirits. The lexicon’s hint that 200 = ariki (chief) and its appearance in genealogical contexts suggests if the Staff had long personal name lists, we might see that glyph. However, 200 is not especially common on the Staff (not at nearly the frequency of 76 or 606), so the balance of evidence leans toward mythic beings over enumerated kings.

Our cross-reference thus far supports a **coherent reading**: the Staff is narrating in Rongorongo a Rapa Nui procreation chant, using a mix of logographic signs for key nouns (birds, fish, sun, etc.) and a dedicated glyph for the act of procreation. Each segment is essentially a **pictorial equation** of creation. By consulting the dataset for each glyph, we ensure that the meanings we assign are grounded in prior research (for instance, we did not randomly assign “sun” to glyph 8 – it was strongly indicated by multiple sources). This reduces the subjectivity in decipherment. Of course, many glyphs on the Staff remain to be definitively identified – we have focused on a few principal ones. In ongoing work, we would continue this approach: identify a recurring sequence, hypothesize a translation, then check the lexicon if those glyphs have known or plausible values. For example, if we encounter a sequence like **“300.76 400 200”** (hypothetically), we could guess “mother copulated with child begat man” – which sounds like nonsense literally, but could hint at a lineage transition (maybe an end of cosmogony and start of royal lineage). The lexicon values (300 = woman/mother, 400 = child, 200 = man/chief) would back up those word meanings. We could then seek a myth or legend where a divine woman and a child produce a chief – perhaps an allusion to the first human? In Rapa Nui legend, the creator god Make-Make creates humans, or Hotu Matuꞌa (the first king) has a miraculous birth story; the Staff might encode such transitions in symbolic form.

In conclusion, the multi-layer decipherment of the Santiago Staff – combining **pattern analysis, linguistic/rebus clues, mythological context, and the provided glyph lexicon** – strongly points to its text being a **cosmogonic genealogy or creation chant**. Each vertical-bar-separated segment likely corresponds to a verse describing how a certain entity came into being through the union of preceding entities. By identifying recurring glyph combinations (like 606+76+700 → 8) and matching them with Polynesian creation motifs (birds and fish producing the sun, etc.), we lay a credible foundation for interpreting each section of the Staff. This integrated approach does not “solve” the rongorongo script outright (which remains undeciphered), but it provides a **working schema** to translate one of its most enigmatic texts in a way that is internally consistent and culturally plausible.

Going forward, this framework can be applied to **decipher other parts of the rongorongo corpus**. If indeed the Staff is a cosmogonic text, perhaps other tablets that share smaller phrases with it might also be creation-related. Our methodology – identify glyph pattern → apply phonetic/rebus and lexicon → seek mythological fit – can be reused for those. Additionally, if the Staff’s content ever overlaps with a known **Rapa Nui chant text** (such as portions of Atua Matariri or others recorded by early ethnographers), that could provide a Rosetta Stone for certain glyphs. The preliminary decipherment presented here will serve as a baseline for such comparative studies, moving us one step closer to unlocking the rich heritage encoded in Rapa Nui’s rongorongo script.

**Sources:** The analysis above cites connected scholarly references and uses the provided Rongorongo lexicon data for glyph meanings. Key references include Fischer’s 1997 study of the Santiago Staff’s procreation chant hypothesis, Guy’s critiques and the *Atua Matariri* chant example, as well as the compiled glyph corpus data which aligns with our interpretations. These sources collectively strengthen the view of Text I as a structured cosmological genealogy in the rongorongo script.
