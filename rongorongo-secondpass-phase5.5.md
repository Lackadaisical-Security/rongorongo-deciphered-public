# Comprehensive Analysis of the Mamari

## ## Rongorongo Tablet

### Overview and Significance

The Mamari tablet (Rongorongo text C) is one of the best-preserved and most studied rongorongo
inscriptions from Easter Island. It measures about 29 × 19.5 × 2.5 cm, carved on Pacific rosewood, and is
regarded by some as possibly the oldest surviving tablet 1 . Crucially, Mamari contains the only partially
deciphered content in the entire rongorongo corpus - it encodes what is widely believed to be the Rapa
Nui lunisolar calendar 2 . This makes Mamari a cornerstone for understanding how the ancient Rapanui
tracked time and integrated astronomy with their cultural practices.
Mamari’s text comprises roughly 14 lines per side (~1000 glyphs total) 3 . Its content is multifaceted: one
section is an astronomical calendar, while other passages parallel texts on other tablets, hinting at
genealogies or cosmological chants 4 5 . Early 20th-century oral tradition gave conflicting accounts - for
example, one informant fancifully claimed a “ranga” tablet listed enemy names to confer victory in war 4 -
but modern analysis shows Mamari’s tone is calendrical and ritual, not a war roster. In fact, segments of
Mamari are shared verbatim with other tablets (E, G, K, N), suggesting those lines record standard chants
or lineage lists used across different inscriptions 5 . For instance, the frequent appearance of a “child/
offspring” glyph (Barthel #400) - meaning descendant or young one - on Mamari and other tablets supports
the presence of genealogy or creation sequences in those shared passages 6 . Overall, Mamari stands out
as a rare case where scholars have gone beyond pure speculation to identify a concrete meaning (the
calendar) within the otherwise still-mysterious rongorongo script.
The Lunar Calendar Content
The most celebrated breakthrough is the discovery that Mamari encodes a lunar month with each glyph
(or glyph group) representing one night of the moon’s cycle 7 . Thomas Barthel first identified this in 1958,
noting a long sequence of glyphs (starting near the end of line 6 on one side and running through lines 7
and 8) that repeated in a patterned way consistent with a list of 30 nights 8 . Subsequent researchers
confirmed that this sequence maps onto the traditional Rapa Nui month, whose night names were
independently recorded by ethnographers like Thomson, Englert, and Métraux 9 10 . In fact, Mamari’s
lunar list aligns “almost perfectly” with those 19th-century lists of moon nights 10 11 , giving us confidence
in the decipherment.
Each night in the Rapa Nui lunar month had a specific name and meaning, often reflected in the
corresponding glyph’s shape or associated symbol. For example:
* “Kokore” nights (glyph: simple crescent) - The calendar sequence includes six consecutive plain
crescent shapes with no distinctive adjuncts 12 . These correspond to Kokore tahi, rua, toru... ono
(“first to sixth kokore”) 13 14 , which were literally the “nameless” nights immediately following the new moon or full moon. (In many Polynesian languages kore or kokore means “nothing/not present,”
implying these nights had no special name 12 .) Thus the tablet simply shows a crescent glyph
repeated six times to mark Kokore 1-6 in sequence.
* Glyph 74 (“hua” - fruit) - A fruit-like rounded glyph appears at the position of the Hua night, which
is the first quarter moon 15 . Polynesian metaphors liken the waxing half-moon to a ripening fruit,
so the glyph for night 10 (Hua) is drawn as a swollen, round shape suggestive of a fruit or bulging
pod 15 . This clever pictograph matches the meaning of hua (“fruit” or “to produce fruit”) and signals
the moon at first quarter - swelling with light like a fruit growing full 16 17 .
* Glyph 143 (“rakau” - tree) - Just before the full moon, the sequence shows a glyph shaped like a
tree or woody plant 18 . This corresponds to Ra kau (or Rakau), the night immediately before full
moon 19 . The word rakau means “tree, wood” in Rapa Nui and other Polynesian tongues, and the
tablet’s tree glyph aptly symbolizes the moon’s fullness about to bloom (much as a fully grown tree)
20 . In context, Rakau is the 14th night, marking the eve of the full moon 19 .
* Glyph 152 (“Omotohi” - full moon) - The full moon night is represented by a distinctive glyph often
interpreted as a fully shaded circle or a figure. Rapa Nui called the full moon night Omutu or Omotohi
21 . On Mamari, this glyph has been described as depicting the “Cook in the Moon” - a panPolynesian folkloric image of a person (a cook or rabbit, etc.) seen on the moon’s face 22 . In any
case, it clearly marks the full moon (night 15) in the center of the sequence, as confirmed by its
position and by later researchers 7 . Notably, a small 19th-century Easter Island pendant (the
“Sacred amulet”) also contains multiple instances of this same full-moon glyph, apparently as part of
a mini lunar calendar inscription 23 . The amulet’s partial duplication of Mamari’s full-moon sign in
the proper sequence underscores that the glyph’s identification as “full moon” is broadly valid
outside this tablet as well.
* Glyph 78 (“maure” - waning gibbous) - Following the full moon, the tablet shows a glyph which
Guy identified as Maure, a named night during the waning gibbous phase 24 . The term maure may
derive from ma (with) + ure (penis) in Polynesian languages. Indeed, the corresponding glyph has a
small appendage resembling an animal’s phallus attached to it 25 . This is likely a deliberate
phonetic pun or rebus: the artist added a phallic shape (Polynesian ure) to reinforce the reading
“Ma-ure.” This clever addition acts as a phonetic complement, confirming the night name while
simultaneously alluding to fertilizing or waning potency as the moon’s light diminishes 25 . Such
details show the scribes weren’t just listing nights but also encoding multilayered meaning via visual
pun.
* Glyph 280 (“honu” - turtle) - Near the end of the lunar cycle, as the moon vanishes, Mamari depicts
a turtle-like glyph 26 27 . Sea turtles (honu in Rapa Nui) often symbolize longevity, the earth, and
creation across Polynesian cultures 27 . In the Mamari calendar this turtle glyph corresponds to the
dark moon or final “dead” nights when the moon is invisible 28 29 . Culturally, placing a turtle at the
moon’s disappearance conveys the idea of the moon returning to the primal ocean or earth before
its rebirth. Researchers have noted that in Rapa Nui tradition this glyph may also be associated with
the god Rongo (a major deity of fertility and agriculture) during the dark moon phase 30 . Thus, the
new moon night seems linked to Rongo via the turtle symbol - an auspicious pairing of lunar rebirth
with the god of crops, hinting that the new moon signaled time to plant or perform fertility rites.
Indeed, in many traditions “the turtle symbolizes the earth and creation” 27 , so ending the month
on this glyph poetically represents a return to earth before the lunar cycle starts anew.
Visualization of the Mamari tablet’s calendrical sequence (lines Ca6-Ca8). Here, the 30 nights of the lunar month
are highlighted in color for clarity. Red marks each of the “28 + 2” named nights, with the full moon at the center
of the sequence 7 . A recurring purple cluster is a short repeated sequence that appears eight times throughout
the calendar 31 (possibly a refrain or divider between moon phases or months). The yellow fish glyphs illustrate a
remarkable detail: during the waxing half of the month the fish are drawn head-up, and during the waning half
they are drawn head-down, encoding the moon’s increasing or decreasing illumination 32 . Green highlights small
adjunct glyphs that researcher Jacques Guy proposed are phonetic complements - extra marks to cue
pronunciation (for example, a tiny phallic shape on the “Maure” glyph to signify -ure) 33 .
As the image and examples show, the Mamari calendar portion is ingeniously constructed. The waxing vs.
waning moon is indicated not only by the progression of named nights but even by the orientation of
certain symbols. For instance, a fish glyph appears regularly in the sequence; each time before the full
moon it is carved upright ( ↑) and each time after the full moon it is inverted ( ↓), visually signaling
🐟 🐟
that the moon is past full and “turning down” 32 . Such details suggest the scribes were keen to encode
astronomical observations in multiple redundant ways - via glyph choice, glyph orientation, and added
marks. This level of structuring allowed modern scholars to deduce the meaning with high confidence. As
one source notes, “in all four heralding sequences preceding the full moon the fish is head up; in all four
following it the fish is head down, suggesting the waxing and waning of the moon” 34 . The full moon itself
is placed centrally, with 14 nights before and 14 after (hence “28+2” nights: 28 standard nights plus 2 extra)
7 .
Structure and Intercalation
Notably, Rapa Nui (like other Polynesians) used a lunisolar calendar, meaning they had to occasionally
adjust the lunar months to keep in sync with the solar year’s seasons. A synodic month is ~29.5 days, so a
strict 28-day cycle would drift quickly. The historical data indicate that the Rapanui normally counted 28
named nights and had 1-2 intercalary nights that could be added when needed to make a 29- or 30-day
month 35 36 . These two extra nights are known by name: Hotu and Hiro. Metraux’s informants gave a full
list of 30 names (including Hotu and Hiro), Englert’s list had only 28 (omitting both), and Thomson’s list had
29 (omitting one of them) 11 . The Mamari tablet itself seems to confirm this scheme. Guy’s analysis points
out that one extra glyph Hotu (“fruitful”) appears just before full moon in some versions (likely to be inserted
if the moon hasn’t yet reached full brightness), and another Hiro (a word associated with darkness or a
deity) would come near the very end of the cycle before the next new moon 37 38 . In Thomson’s 1886
observation, for example, the night Hotu was recorded as a supplemental night just before full moon, and
Hiro was apparently the last moonless night before the new moon 11 38 . Scholars surmise that Hotu and
Hiro were essentially leap-days of the lunar calendar, added as needed to ensure each lunation matched
the actual moon. One modern analysis concurs: “The days hotu and hiro appear to be intercalary… A 28-day
calendar month needs one to two intercalary days to keep in phase with the 29½-day lunar month” 36 . This
clever lunar accounting system is actually hinted at on another rongorongo artifact: a small inscribed
amulet shows a series of 29 crescent marks with a certain pattern of dots, which may encode a rule for
when to insert the extra nights 39 40 . In short, the Mamari tablet doesn’t just list a static 30-night
sequence; it embodies a flexible lunisolar system, complete with mechanisms for calibration.
Traditional Night Names and Meanings
Cross-referencing Mamari’s glyphs with Rapa Nui’s known moon-night names reveals a rich tapestry of
symbolism that connects the script to oral tradition and pan-Polynesian cosmology. Some noteworthy
correspondences include:
* Ata - The very start of the cycle corresponds to Ata (recorded by Metraux) or Oata (Thomson) for the
new moon night, meaning “shadow” or “obscured” 41 . Fittingly, the new moon glyph on Mamari is
a darkened crescent, conveying the moon in shadow. Polynesian languages use ata for shadow/
dawn; the new moon was seen as a time of darkness, so the term is apt 42 .
* Ari - The next night, when the first faint crescent becomes visible, is called Ari (or Oari in Thomson’s
transcription) 43 . Guy notes ari is likely cognate to Hawaiian ‘ali meaning “bright” or “to appear
white” 44 - an allusion to the first glint of moonlight reappearing. On Mamari, the crescent for Ari is
accompanied by a curious loop or lasso-shaped glyph with barbs 44 . This might depict a ritual
object used in new-moon ceremonies: Katherine Routledge reported that at new moon, rongorongo
experts gathered at Anakena and stuck feathered strings (heu-heu and white feather maru cords)
into the ground as part of a ceremony 45 . The barbed loop glyph may well represent those strings
of white feathers, tying the inscription to an actual ritual practice marking the new moon 45 . This
is a great example of how closely the rongorongo signs could mirror real ceremonial items and
events.
* Kokore series - As mentioned, nights 3-8 (and also certain nights after full) were labeled Kokore 1-6,
meaning essentially “No-name one, two, … six.” The tablet denotes these with plain crescents and no
unique adjunct - a concise way to say “just a moon, nothing special” for those nights 12 46 . The
linguistic insight (Hawaiian ‘a‘ole = “no, none”) confirms the interpretation of kokore as empty or
name-less nights 12 .
* Māharu - Night 9 in all lists is Maharu, which typically corresponds to the moon reaching its first
quarter half-light 47 . The word can mean the moon at half or a paleness. The Mamari glyph here is
a crescent with perhaps a slight modification indicating it’s half full (some sources translate Maharu
as a specific stage with possibly little glyph commentary needed beyond being a crescent with a
mark).
* ‘Ohua - Night 10, Hua (with an honorific “o” as ‘Ohua in some recitations), meaning “fruit.” We saw
the fruit glyph here, symbolizing the waxing bulge of the moon 17 . Guy even notes the glyph’s
shape could double as a visual pun for either a fruit or a human scrotum - both being round
“swelling” objects - reinforcing the idea of fertility and growth at this stage 17 . The use of such
imagery (fruit of the tree, or generative organs) emphasizes the moon’s potency as it approaches
full.
* ‘Atua - Night 11 was recorded as Otua (Thomson) or Atua (Métraux), which literally means “god” or
“spirit” in Polynesian 48 . Mamari’s glyph for this night appears to be a feather cape or garment, an
item associated with high chiefs and gods 48 . This strongly suggests the night name was
understood as Atua and was represented by a symbol of divinity or chiefly rank (feather cloaks were
sacred regalia). Interestingly, after ‘Atua, some calendars include an extra night Hotu (“to bear fruit”)
before the full moon 37 . As discussed, Hotu was likely an intercalary night added when needed. Its meaning “fruitful” dovetails with the idea of an extra growth night before the moon becomes
completely full. Mamari may or may not depict Hotu explicitly depending on how the sequence is
interpreted - it might be one of the small variations in the repeated sequences (some researchers
suspect a particular glyph can indicate the insertion of Hotu when required) 48 .
* Maure, Ina-ira, Rakau - Nights 12, 13, 14 we have already covered in part: Maure with the phallic
marker 25 , Ina-ira, and Rakau with the tree symbol 19 . The name Ina-ira is intriguing; it likely
references the moon goddess Hina (since in many Pacific cultures, Hina is the female deity of the
moon). The Rapa Nui pronunciation could have dropped an initial H, making Ina akin to Hina, and ira
might mean “faint” or “gleaming.” Although Guy’s summary did not expound on Ina-ira in the visible
snippet, the context suggests Ina-ira could mean something like “Moon-Maid” or refer to a myth of
Hina. In any case, it sits just before Rakau and seems to be another specific name in the lead-up to
full moon.
* Omotohi (Full Moon) - The 15th night, as noted, is full moon. The term Omotohi in Rapa Nui
possibly relates to motohi (“cut off”) implying the peak/cut of the month. The glyph, showing the
“man (or cook) in the moon,” indicates the cultural lore tied to the full moon 22 . Polynesian myths
often speak of a figure (like a rabbit, a tree, or a face) visible on the moon; Easter Island apparently
had a notion of a cooker or person on the moon, which the glyph artist tried to portray. This is a
beautiful example of mythology encoded in script: not only the fact of full moon, but the mythic
personage associated with it is recorded.
After the full moon, the calendar sequence continues with nights 16-30 which mirror the waxing half in
reverse (with some different names). Thomson’s list (see Rapa Nui Calendar reference) records these
waning nights after Omotohi full moon as follows 49 50 : Kokore 1-5 again (showing the period
immediately after full had five “nameless” nights in that particular month), then specific names like Tapume,
Matua, Orongo, Orongo taane, Mauri nui, Marui kero, Omutu, Tueo, Oata, and finally Ohiro (Hiro) for
the new moon’s eve. Not all these appear in every historical source, but they are largely consistent.
On Mamari, the waning half is marked by the same structural cues: the fish glyphs flip upside-down to
denote the moon’s “descent” 32 , and many night-name glyphs reappear (sometimes with slight changes) to
indicate the corresponding concept now in a waning context. For instance, Orongo (a term meaning
“announcement” or name of a ceremonial site) shows up around the last quarter. Indeed, Thomson noted
Orongo as the name of the night corresponding to the last quarter moon (though he labeled it “first
quarter [sic]” on Dec 18, which was actually the third-quarter phase) 50 . The repetition of names like
Kokore and Orongo in both halves of the month might indicate they had a waxing Orongo and waning
Orongo, etc., or simply that some names were reused at opposite sides of the cycle. In many Polynesian
lunar calendars, nights after full moon often take new names (e.g. Māori and Tahitian systems), but Rapa
Nui’s scheme seems to reuse Kokore and perhaps Orongo, which is an interesting local peculiarity.
Crucially, the last two nights of the cycle were often the dark moon nights where the moon disappears. As
discussed, one of these was likely Hiro. The name Hiro in Polynesia (or Whiro in Māori) often denotes the
new moon or a moon deity associated with darkness and sometimes mischief. Rapa Nui’s Hiro appears to
be an extra “ghost” night inserted at the very end when needed 11 38 . Thomson’s informants did not
mention Hiro (perhaps because the month he recorded had only one dark night Tueo before Oata new
moon), but Métraux’s did. In Rapa Nui rock art and folklore, Hiro is also a figure connected to rain and
perhaps the gecko/lizard motif. Interestingly, one lexicon entry identifies a lizard-like glyph (possibly #69) as moko (lizard) associated with Hiro, the rain god 51 . If a lizard glyph occurs on the tablet, it could signify a
prayer for rain tied to the lunar cycle (rain would be critical for agriculture, tying the calendar to farming
needs). Though the Mamari’s known calendar section doesn’t overtly feature a lizard sign in the published
transcriptions, the association of Hiro (dark moon) with a rain-bringing gecko deity is a tantalizing clue that
weather and agriculture were on the minds of the calendar-keepers. It suggests that certain lunar nights
(perhaps at the end of the cycle or specific months) were linked to invoking rain or other environmental
phenomena.
Astronomical and Cosmological Aspects
The Mamari tablet reveals the sophisticated astronomical knowledge of the Rapanui people. By encoding
the lunar month, they preserved information on moon phases, and the tablet likely served as a guide or
mnemonic for priests to track time. The fact that the heads of the fish glyphs mark waxing vs waning
demonstrates an keen observational detail - essentially, a graphic phase diagram carved centuries ago
32 . Such deliberate orientation implies the scribes expected the reader to know the convention, meaning
this was part of a broader astronomical notation system in rongorongo.
Beyond the moon’s phases, researchers have found hints that Mamari’s calendar connects with other
celestial cycles and events:
* Solar Year and Equinox: Because the Rapa Nui calendar was lunisolar, the tablet’s information
would have been used in conjunction with observations of the sun to keep the calendar aligned to
seasons. Rapanui priest-astronomers likely tracked the solstices and equinoxes using megalithic
aids (e.g. stone alignments or “sun stones”). One study notes that the island’s “astronomer-priests…
could predict the day of the vernal equinox not only with the aid of ‘sun stones’ but also by counting
the phases of the moon,” and that elements of these calculations appear to have been deciphered on
the Mamari tablet 52 . In other words, by knowing the lunar cycle positions, they could anticipate
when in the month an equinox would fall. The annual bird-man (Tangata Manu) competition on
Rapa Nui was tied to the spring equinox and the appearance of the Manutara seabirds; Mamari’s
combined lunar/ritual calendar likely helped fix that timing (we will discuss the bird connection more
below). The integration of solar and lunar cycles in Mamari underscores that it was a true
calendrical tool, not merely a list of moon nights.
* Eclipse Cycles: Recent research has gone further to propose that Mamari encodes not just a single
month, but patterns corresponding to the Saros and Metonic cycles - long-range periodicities of
eclipses and lunar months. A 2025 computational study applied a method originally developed for
deciphering the Phaistos Disk, treating certain glyph sequences in Mamari as representing the 223month Saros cycle (≈18 years, 11 days) and the 235-month Metonic cycle (≈19 years) 53 . According
to the authors, lines Ca6-Ca9 of Mamari contain repeating structures that could function as a
cosmic clock, allowing priests to predict when lunar and solar eclipses would occur 54 55 . For
example, a glyph showing a person with raised hands (Barthel #380) is interpreted as an
astronomer or priest glyph, appearing at regular intervals to mark observational checkpoints 56 .
Likewise, a bird glyph (Barthel #600) repeats in a pattern that the researchers link to ritual “nesting”
periods in the calendar 56 . By correlating these patterns with NASA eclipse tables, they found a
striking alignment around the years AD 1248-1267. In fact, the fit was statistically significant (they
report a ~94% match, p≈0.009) that Mamari’s sequence of glyph intervals matches the sequence of
visible eclipses in the mid-13th century 55 . This suggests the tablet might have been created around that time to record or predict those celestial events. If true, it means the Rapanui were
performing a level of astronomical prediction comparable to other advanced ancient cultures -
using a lunisolar calendar to foresee eclipses, which have a known periodicity. While this theory is
still under peer review, it is a fascinating example of how deep analysis (including computer
simulations and AI) is shedding light on rongorongo. It elevates Mamari from a simple list of nights
to a sophisticated astronomical document that could encode decades-long cycles.
* Cosmology and Myth: The Mamari calendar also embeds Rapanui cosmological concepts. We saw
how certain nights like Atua (God) and the full-moon “Cook in the Moon” reflect mythic ideas. The
presence of Hina (if “Ina-ira” is indeed invoking Hina, the moon goddess) would place Rapa Nui’s
lunar lore in line with widespread Polynesian mythology where Hina lives in or controls the moon.
Additionally, the turtle glyph at new moon ties into creation mythology - in many cultures a turtle
carries the earth or is present at the world’s foundation 27 . Its association with the god Rongo on
Easter Island is notable 30 : Rongo in East Polynesia is the god of agriculture (and peace), often
connected with the element of earth and growth 57 . That Mamari uses the turtle (earth) at the
rebirth of the moon hints that the Rapanui saw each lunar cycle as a miniature creation/
rejuvenation cycle, blessed by Rongo’s fertilizing power. We can imagine that new moon ceremonies
(perhaps involving yam or sweet potato planting) were held under the patronage of Rongo to ensure
a good harvest, thus bridging astronomy and agriculture. Indeed, Rapa Nui’s very year start was
tied to a mythic-agricultural event: the landing of founder Hotu Matu’a in August (which began their
calendar year) 58 . The months themselves had seasonal names like Hora-iti “little
summer” (September) and Hora-nui “big summer” (October) 59 , indicating a keen awareness of
seasonal cycles. The Mamari tablet’s role would have been to coordinate the lunar months (mahina
or marama) with these solar-tied months so that, for example, harvest and planting rituals aligned
with the correct moon and season.
* Verification in Rock Art: The interpretation of Mamari as a lunar calendar is further bolstered by
Easter Island rock art. Certain petroglyphs on the island feature series of crescents or dot
markings in groups of 30, strongly suggesting a reference to the 30-night lunar month 60 . One
study notes that a “tally-like group of crescents” appears in a rock carving and could be related to the
lunar month count 60 . Additionally, an engraved artifact found in recent decades (dubbed the “lunar
amulet”) shows a short sequence of rongorongo-like glyphs that, when compared to Mamari,
overlaps in content concerning the full moon and surrounding nights 61 23 . Though this amulet
may have been created post-missionary contact (even as late as 1885, as an antiquarian souvenir), it
copies the traditional lunar calendar signs - implying that knowledge of the lunar glyph sequence
persisted and was transcribed even outside the main tablets 62 . All these independent pieces - rock
carvings, late artifacts, and ethnographic lists - cross-validate the Mamari calendar. There is
“beyond reasonable doubt” that this portion of text is a lunar calendar 63 , making it the sole
rongorongo text whose general meaning is known with confidence.
Cultural and Multidisciplinary Insights
Analyzing the Mamari tablet from multiple angles - astronomy, agriculture, iconography, linguistics, and
ethnography - reveals how integrated the Rapanui worldview was. Mamari’s calendar was not an isolated
scientific record; it was embedded in ritual life, farming, navigation, and myth.
Agricultural Calendar: As the god of cultivated crops, Rongo’s presence in the calendar hints that
planting cycles may have been timed by the moon 27 30 . Many cultures plant certain crops by the moon
(for instance, planting on a waxing moon for better growth). In Rapa Nui’s case, the lunisolar calendar
would help determine when the rainy season was coming or when to expect certain food cycles. The
months listed by Thomson show the Rapanui year split into a warm season (Hora, summer) and a cool
season (Vaitu, winter) 64 65 . Activities like harvesting sweet potatoes likely took place in specific months
and perhaps on particular moon phases (the sweet potato was a staple whose planting was critical -
interestingly, one archaeo-astronomy paper is titled “Mars and Sweet Potatoes” 66 , suggesting even
planetary sightings were linked to planting lore on Easter Island). The Mamari calendar, being lunisolar,
would inform the priests when to insert an extra month to keep the seasons aligned - crucial for ensuring,
say, that the month of Maro (July) actually fell in winter when certain tasks were done. The intercalation rule
(Hotu/Hiro nights) effectively prevents drift, thereby serving agricultural scheduling. In summary,
agriculture was regulated by this calendar, marrying the practical (food production) with the celestial.
Ritual and Navigation: The birdman cult that emerged in later centuries (circa 16th-19th century) on
Easter Island was centered on the annual arrival and egg-laying of the Manu tara (sooty tern) at Orongo
village, an event tied to the spring equinox. There is evidence that the Mamari tablet’s creators already
observed bird and season relationships. The study by Rjabchikov (2016-2017) interprets glyph 600 (a bird)
on Mamari as marking a “proto-birdman” ritual in the calendar 56 . They argue that a period labeled “Hina
6 - Sacred Nesting” in the text corresponds to months 9-11 of the year when the seabirds would nest 67 . If
this is correct, it means the practice of associating the lunar calendar with bird nesting seasons predated
the formal Tangata Manu competition. Essentially, the Mamari calendar might contain a ritual schedule for
bird propitiation or observation that the later birdman cult inherited. We also see two occurrences of the
name Orongo in the lunar night list 50 , which is remarkable - Orongo is the very site of the birdman rites.
Its appearance as a “quarter” night name might not be coincidental; it could memorialize an old ritual at last
quarter moon held at Orongo. Thus, Mamari provides a link between astronomy and religious ceremony.
Additionally, some researchers have posited that beyond months and ritual, rongorongo might encode
navigational star calendars or other astronomical knowledge. While Mamari itself focuses on the moon, the
ability to count nights and perhaps mark a sidereal cycle (the Reddit discussion about a “sidereal 13-moon
calendar” on line 9, for example) hints the script could extend to stars. It is known that Polynesian
navigation relied on star paths and lunar cycles, so a highly advanced lunisolar calendar could also double
as a navigator’s almanac. However, concrete evidence of star references on Mamari is slim compared to the
lunar content.
Linguistic and Cross-Cultural: The decipherment of Mamari’s calendar is a triumph of comparative
linguistics and iconographic analysis working together. By comparing Rapanui lunar terms with related
words in Hawaiian, Tahitian, Māori, etc., scholars like Guy could guess glyph meanings (e.g., recognizing
kokore as related to Tahitian ‘aore, “no”) 12 . The visual shapes of glyphs often corroborated these guesses
(the tree for rakau, fruit for hua, phallus for ure in ma-ure) 18 17 . This multi-pronged approach - aligning
ethnographic records, Polynesian etymologies, and pictorial clues - was key to unlocking the calendar.
It demonstrates that rongorongo, though stylized, is not an arbitrary code; it’s deeply rooted in the Rapanui
language and the broader Polynesian symbolic repertoire. For instance, the notion of 30 lunar nights is
common across Polynesia (Hawaiians count 30 nights, Māori ~30 nights, etc.), and many night names recur
across islands (e.g., Hiro/Whiro as new moon, Kāhore/Kokore as unnamed nights, Māori/Mauri for certain
phase, Hotu for fruiting, Raka(u) for near-full, Maure in some form, Hua for quarter, etc.) 12 68 . Mamari
essentially confirmed that Rapa Nui’s calendar fit this family pattern, settling a long-standing question and giving credence to the idea that rongorongo script encodes the Rapa Nui language (not some imported
tongue or pure ideographs). The fact that Jacques Guy identified possible phonetic elements (like the -ure
symbol) 25 also suggests rongorongo might use a mixed writing system - primarily logographic (one glyph
= one concept/night) but with occasional phonetic hints. Such complexity is reminiscent of other
hieroglyphic scripts and raises hope that more of rongorongo can eventually be read using similar crossdisciplinary sleuthing.
Finally, it’s important to stress that the Mamari tablet’s analysis has been iterative and cumulative. Early
pioneers (Barthel) first saw the broad calendar structure 69 ; later, meticulous comparisons by Guy and
others matched glyphs to specific night names 10 17 ; more recently, advanced methods (AI pattern
matching, statistical validation) are testing new hypotheses about long-term cycles and hidden information
70 55 . Each methodology, from traditional epigraphy to computer simulation, has added a layer of
insight. And crucially, independent confirmations - Thomson’s 1886 diary, Routledge’s 1914 notes,
Marquesan petroglyph analogues 67 , and modern Rapa Nui oral history - have been used to verify the
tablet’s content. This multi-pronged verification is why scholars are confident in the calendar reading. As a
1990 journal article declared, “Tablet Mamari contains the only text whose general meaning is known beyond
reasonable doubt: a lunar calendar” 63 . Over 30 years later, that statement still holds, and ongoing research
continues to expand that meaning (e.g. into eclipse prediction and ritual scheduling), showing that
Mamari may have served astronomical, agricultural, and ceremonial functions all at once.
Conclusion
The Mamari rongorongo tablet stands as a remarkable record where geology, ecology, and astronomy
converge in writing. It encodes the cycles of the moon (astronomy) in a way that guided planting and
harvesting (agriculture) and was intertwined with creation myths and deities of earth and rain (geology/
ecology as symbolism). Mamari’s lunar calendar sequence is a clear example of the rongorongo script being
used functionally - to track time and inform ritual actions - rather than being a random list of symbols.
Through meticulous research, we have identified its glyphs for new moon, full moon, and many nights in
between 17 71 , as well as structural markers for waxing vs waning phases 32 and even extra days for
calendar adjustment 36 . The tablet likely helped Rapanui priests decide when to perform certain
ceremonies (for example, when the moon was right for fishing or planting, or when to prepare for the
annual birdman egg hunt). Its content is multi-layered: at once a practical almanac, a religious calendar,
and a repository of cultural knowledge (myths of Hina, symbols of Rongo, etc.).
The decipherment of Mamari’s calendar has been a triumph of cross-correlation: by validating rongorongo
glyphs against ethnographic records, comparing motifs across Polynesia, and even aligning patterns
with astronomical events, researchers have peeled back one layer of the rongorongo mystery 10 55 .
This success offers a blueprint for future progress on the script. Mamari shows that rongorongo is not
impenetrable - when context and clever analysis are available, the glyphs do speak. As more scholars apply
multi-method approaches (from AI to paleography), we may discover that other tablets contain similar
calendars, historical genealogies, or cosmological texts, all mutually cross-referencing.
In summary, the Mamari tablet provides a comprehensive glimpse into how the people of Easter Island
encoded their world: the turning of nights and months, the interplay of earth and sky, the scheduling of
feasts and planting, and the reverence for gods and ancestors - all etched in glyphs on a wooden board. It
is a calendrical encyclopedia that links the astronomical (lunar phases, possibly eclipse cycles) with the
terrestrial (seasons of growth, rain, bird nesting) and the spiritual (deities like Rongo and Hina, ritual gatherings at Anakena and Orongo). Each of these angles enriches our understanding of Mamari, and
together they verify its purpose. The Mamari tablet, therefore, is not only partially deciphered - it is also
deeply decoded in context, shining light on the intellectual and cultural life of Rapa Nui’s past. The ongoing
research, excluding unsubstantiated fringe claims, continues to build on this solid foundation, inching us
closer to a full appreciation of the rongorongo corpus as a written reflection of Polynesian knowledge and
tradition.
Sources: The above analysis is based on a synthesis of connected research: ethnographic accounts of Rapa
Nui time-keeping by Thomson (1886) 72 73 and others; the seminal identification of Mamari’s lunar
calendar by Barthel (1958) 7 ; detailed glyph-by-glyph studies by Guy (1990) 74 17 ; modern
computational decipherment attempts by López (2025) 70 55 ; and cross-cultural comparisons of
Polynesian lunar lore 12 48 . These sources collectively confirm the Mamari tablet’s calendrical function
and provide multiple interpretive “lenses” (linguistic, astronomical, iconographic) through which to
understand its inscriptions. The convergence of evidence from these varied methods gives us confidence in
the multifaceted interpretation presented here.
