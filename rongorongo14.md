# Deciphering the Mamari Tablet: Multi-Method Cross-Referencing Approaches

## Introduction to Rongorongo and the Challenge of Decipherment

Rongorongo is the mysterious script of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), first recorded by outsiders in the 19th century. It consists of glyphs carved on wooden objects, and to this day it remains undeciphered. Unlike scripts such as the Rosetta Stone or cuneiform, Rongorongo has no known bilingual text or clear **context**, making interpretation extremely challenging. Scholars face a *lack of context and comparative material* – there are no ancient illustrations or translations to guide reading, and modern Rapa Nui has changed under outside influence, meaning the original language of the tablets may differ from the Rapa Nui spoken today. About two dozen inscribed objects survive, but their content is enigmatic. Any successful decipherment will require **multiple approaches used in tandem**, from internal pattern analysis to cultural context and cross-script comparisons. In this deep dive, we focus on the Mamari tablet (Text C) – one of the most studied tablets – and explore how combining methods and cross-referencing data can yield insights.

## The Mamari Tablet and Its Lunar Calendar Sequence

The **Mamari tablet** (Rongorongo text C) is famous for containing the **Rapa Nui lunar calendar** – the only portion of Rongorongo widely accepted as partially understood. On one side of the Mamari tablet, a sequence of glyphs repeats in a regular pattern about 30 times, which strongly suggested a **calendrical text**. Researchers confirmed that this sequence represents the **30 nights of a lunar month**. Ethnographic data recorded by William Thomson in 1886 provided the traditional Rapanui names for nights of the month, and these correspond nicely to Mamari’s 30 repeating segments. In other words, Mamari’s text encodes a lunisolar month with all expected nights (including two special “leap nights”), aligning Easter Island with broader Polynesian calendar systems.

Each nightly segment on Mamari is marked by a **crescent moon glyph** (Barthel sign *10*) to denote “moon” or “night”. These crescents vary in shape/position to indicate the moon’s phase (waxing or waning). Notably, the **full moon night** is marked by a distinct **oval glyph (sign 152)**, which appears once at the midpoint of the sequence. Scholars interpret glyph 152 as a pictograph of the full moon – it’s a circular shape with internal markings that some have fancifully linked to seeing a “face” or lunar features. This identification is highly confident (our lexicon marks it \~90% confidence) because full moon placement in the sequence matches exactly where it should in a 30-day cycle. The sequence is subdivided by **heralding marker groups** of four glyphs that separate the lunar months into traditional named sections. Interestingly, these marker groups include a fish glyph whose orientation flips after the full moon – head upward before full moon, head downward after – visually signaling the waxing vs. waning half of the month. In the tablet’s engravings, two very small “superscript” crescents were also noted in specific positions; researchers now believe these represent **intercalary nights** (extra nights occasionally inserted to keep the calendar in sync). All together, Mamari’s calendar covers *30 nights*, fully consistent with lunar astronomy and Polynesian calendrical practice.

This lunar calendar decipherment – though **partial in scope** – is a breakthrough because it provides *firm meanings* for certain glyphs in context (e.g. crescent = “night/moon”, oval = “full moon”) and demonstrates Rongorongo can record systematic information. It also shows the value of **cross-referencing culture and text**: knowledge of Polynesian lunar month structure and Rapa Nui night names was key to recognizing the pattern. For example, early on Bishop Jaussen’s Rapanui informant, Metoro, attempted to *chant-read* Mamari but **failed to identify the obvious full moon glyph** or the nature of the sequence. Modern analysis by contrast, leveraging astronomy and ethnography, decoded this structure decades later. Thus, the Mamari tablet teaches us that context (calendrical or ritual) can unlock glyph meanings when patterns align with expected cultural content.

## Cross-Referencing Rongorongo Texts: Parallel Passages and Shared Phrases

Beyond the Mamari calendar, a powerful decipherment method is **internal cross-comparison** of the Rongorongo corpus. Many tablets show **repeated phrases or parallel texts** – indicating some were copies, variants, or related compositions. For instance, scholars observed one tablet line where a particular glyph compound repeats *31 times*, each followed by a short sequence of other glyphs; James Park Harrison in 1874 speculated this might list **names of chiefs** in a genealogy (with the repeated glyph acting like “son of” or a section marker). Thomas Barthel later confirmed a similar pattern on tablet *K* that parallels the one on tablet *Gr*, reinforcing that these sequences are intentional structures rather than random repetition. In another case, lines Gv5–6 of the Small Santiago tablet (text G) contain a series of about 15 glyphs that Barthel and others noted *could fit a genealogical structure* (e.g. a chain of ancestors). These kinds of patterns suggest some texts are **lists or lineages** formatted in repeating units.

Modern computational studies by Konstantin Pozdniakov (1990s–2000s) took this further: by identifying *allographs* (alternate forms of the same sign) and *ligatures* (two signs fused into one), he normalized Barthel’s original glyph list and then looked for common sequences across 13 of the best-preserved texts. The result was striking – **hundreds of recurring phrases** emerged. By 2007, Pozdniakov had catalogued about *100 shared phrase sequences* (ranging from 10 to 100 glyphs long) that appear in different orders or contexts on different tablets. In fact, except for a couple of unique texts, most tablets turned out to be composed largely of **shared stock phrases**. Some tablets are even *parallel texts* of each other: for example, tablets Gr and K share large portions verbatim, and there is a known “Grand Tradition” set of texts H, P, Q that also largely overlap. This implies that the Rongorongo corpus might consist of a relatively limited set of formulaic **chants, lists, or narratives** that scribes reproduced or remixed across different boards. For decipherment, this is encouraging: if we can crack one phrase’s meaning, it could apply to many occurrences.

Parallel passages also help identify the function of certain glyphs. If two texts are nearly identical but one uses glyph X where another uses a slightly different glyph Y, those might be **allographs or related concepts**. Jacques Guy noted, for example, that some glyphs thought to be distinct were likely variations (he showed glyph *6* and *64* are interchangeable in otherwise identical sequences). Recognizing such cases reduces the inventory of symbols and hints that Rongorongo might have had a **phonetic or syllabic component**, since multiple shapes could represent the same sound or idea. Conversely, when one text substitutes an entirely different glyph in a parallel phrase, that might indicate a synonym or a specific detail changed. All these internal cross-references act like pieces of a puzzle – aligning tablets side by side to see what changes and what stays constant gives clues to structure, syntax, and meaning.

## Iconographic Clues: Glyph Imagery and “Reading” by Pictograph

Another foundational approach is treating Rongorongo glyphs as **pictographs** – stylized images with inherent meaning. The glyph shapes often resemble humans, animals, plants, celestial bodies, or man-made objects, which can guide our interpretations. Cross-referencing these glyphs with common iconography in other cultures or in Easter Island’s own rock art can be surprisingly insightful. Even if two scripts are completely unrelated, they might use similar imagery for the same concept (for example, a crescent shape to mean “moon” is intuitive in many cultures). Below are a few **key glyphs and their hypothesized meanings** based on shape and context:

* **Glyph 1 (Anthropomorphic Figure – “Person”)**: Depicts a basic human figure. It appears in contexts suggesting people or names (e.g. possibly in genealogical lists). Scholars correlate it to the Rapa Nui word *tangata* (“person/human”). This glyph establishes the **human element** in texts, and often combinations like a figure holding an object are seen, potentially denoting a person performing an action.

* **Glyph 8 (Radiate Symbol – “Sun/Light”)**: A round glyph often drawn with emanating rays or a halo. Bishop Jaussen’s informant identified a sun-like glyph with the word *ra’ā* (sun), and later researchers noted this sign tends to occur at the beginnings of lines or sections, possibly marking importance or a time of day. It likely denotes **Sun** or more broadly *light/fire*, given its radial appearance. (Interestingly, glyph 8 could have multiple related meanings – our lexicon notes *ra’a* “sun”, *hetu’u* “star”, *ahi* “fire”, all luminous objects.)

* **Glyph 10 (Crescent – “Moon/Night”)**: A crescent-shaped glyph used to denote the moon or a night. This is the **cornerstone of the Mamari lunar calendar**, where the crescent repeats nightly. It corresponds to *māhina* (moon) in Polynesian language context. The consistent use of a crescent shape for sequential nights was a big hint that this glyph indeed meant “moon” or “month” in the text.

* **Glyph 152 (Circular disk – “Full Moon/Complete”)**: A full circle form with internal markings, identified as the **full moon** in the Mamari sequence. This glyph appears at the climax of the lunar month sequence. Because a full moon represents wholeness or completion, researchers also infer glyph 152 carries the abstract meaning of “complete/entire”. (In our data, it’s given the Rapanui transliterations *oti* or *katoa* – meaning “finished” or “whole” – fittingly for the full moon as the completion of the lunar cycle.)

* **Glyph 20 (Branched shape – “Tree/Plant”)**: A glyph with branching lines, interpreted as a tree or plant. This likely corresponds to *rākau* (tree) or generic plant life. In an agrarian society, references to trees or crops might appear in chants (e.g. lists of flora, or metaphors for lineage as a “tree”). Its presence could mark sections about agriculture or growth. The shape’s resemblance to a tree icon is also supported by Easter Island petroglyphs of plants and perhaps the importance of toromiro wood, etc., in their culture.

* **Glyph 40 (Wavy lines – “Water/Sea”)**: A set of wavy line strokes representing **water** or the sea. Easter Island being a maritime culture, the sea figured prominently. The glyph’s form is a universal pictograph for water (similar wavy lines signify water in Egyptian hieroglyphs and other systems), so it’s not surprising if Rongorongo used it similarly. It may denote *vai* (water) or *moana* (sea) or related concepts like flow. Contextual use might be in myths (e.g. the sea in creation stories) or practical matters (like voyages).

* **Glyph 30 (Rectangular enclosure – “House/Dwelling”)**: A rectangular or oval enclosure shape, thought to mean a **house or structure**. Rapa Nui traditional houses (hare paenga) were elliptical, but the concept of a shelter or sacred enclosure could be depicted abstractly. Knorozov’s team suggested this glyph relates to places or dwellings. If a text mentions the founding of villages or the placement of kings (e.g. “at such-and-such place”), a house/place glyph might appear.

* **Glyph 600 (Bird figure – “Bird/Frigatebird”)**: A bird-shaped glyph, drawn with characteristic features like a long beak or wings. Barthel’s catalog #600 is strongly believed to represent a **bird**, specifically the frigatebird which had deep ritual significance on Rapa Nui. The frigatebird (*manu tara* or *tavake*) was central in the island’s Birdman cult, symbolizing the god Makemake and fertility. Indeed, glyph 600 appears in what are thought to be creation or genealogy texts, possibly as a clan totem or deity symbol. When the bird glyph is **combined with glyph 6 (a hand)**, forming a compound written as *606*, it seems to pluralize the concept to “birds” or a flock. (Glyph 6 “hand” has been linked to *ma’u* “to take” and a plural marker *mau* in Polynesian grammar, an insight from Fischer – more on that later. So 600+6 was read by Fischer as “all the birds”.) The bird glyph exemplifies how **mythological or totemic imagery** on one hand, and grammatical function on the other, might both be encoded via pictographs in Rongorongo.

* **Glyph 76 (Distinctive shape – “Phallus/Procreation”)**: This glyph has a very explicit phallic shape and nearly all researchers agree on its sexual connotation. When present, glyph 76 often attaches to another glyph or appears in a sequence, suggesting it modifies meaning. Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s noticed glyph 76 often follows a human or animal glyph and hypothesized it marks **patronymics or lineage** – essentially indicating “begat” or “offspring of”. Steven Fischer, on the other hand, interpreted 76 more literally as *“copulated with”* in his readings. Either way, it clearly serves a *procreative or relational* function, linking two entities in a fertility or genealogical context. On the long Santiago Staff, for example, glyph 76 appears attached to the first glyph of many sections, as if introducing a relationship. Our lexicon assigns it nearly 95% confidence as *phallus/procreate*, given how unambiguous its shape is and how it features in creation sequences.

* **Glyph 700 (Fish shape – “Fish/Victim”)**: A fish-like glyph represents **fish** (likely *ika* in Rapanui). Fish were a staple food and also had symbolic roles (some legends involve fish, and certain important figures had fish names). However, an intriguing cross-cultural clue: in many Polynesian languages, *ika* “fish” can metaphorically mean a **victim or prey** (for example, in Maori, war casualties are called “fish” of the chief). One scholarly interpretation is that glyph 700 in some contexts doesn’t literally mean a fish swimming in the sea, but a *human victim or sacrifice*. In fact, the Santiago Staff has 63 occurrences of glyph 700, which one Russian hypothesis reads as a rebus for *ika* = “victim”. So, depending on context, 700 might signify a sacrifice in a ritual or someone who was killed, rather than an actual fish to eat. For instance, the sequence **606.76 700** could be read not as “birds copulated with fish” but as **“(Name) son of (Bird) was killed”**, if we take 700 as a victim and 76 as a genealogical/causative marker. This dual possibility (fish vs. victim) exemplifies how a glyph’s pictographic meaning might carry a *secondary symbolic meaning* that only makes sense with knowledge of Polynesian idiom. Cross-referencing Pacific cultures alerted scholars to this layered meaning.

* **Glyph 610 (Composite glyph – “Egg/Origin”)**: Barthel’s list includes composite numbers like 610, which appears to be a combination of the bird (600) with a variant of 10 or a separate “egg” shape. It has been interpreted as an **egg** – logically following the bird motif (birds lay eggs). In Rapa Nui, *hua* means “egg” but also “fruit, seed” and by extension “offspring”. Consequently, glyph 610 is associated not only with a literal egg but with the concept of a **beginning or origin** (the “seed” of something). In creation chants across Polynesia, the image of an egg or seed often symbolizes the start of life. So, seeing an egg glyph in a sequence could hint that the text is describing the *origin of something* (perhaps the first bird, or the first human emerging). This is a good example of how we use one glyph’s presence to surmise thematic content: an egg symbol showing up amid bird glyphs and phallus markers strongly screams “creation story” or “birth of so-and-so”.

These iconographic interpretations are **cross-checked** against Easter Island’s own art and Polynesian symbolism. Many Rongorongo glyphs closely resemble figures in Rapa Nui petroglyphs and rock art. For example, the bird-man motif (half bird, half man) is a famous petroglyph and might also appear in the script in stylized form, perhaps as a combination of glyph 600 (bird) with a human glyph. The consistency of such symbols lends confidence – if something looks like a fish and appears where a fish or offering would make sense, it likely is a fish. This pictorial method was how Bishop Jaussen and his collaborator Metoro initially tried to “read” the tablets in the 1870s: they created a list of glyphs with supposed meanings (the **Jaussen list**). That list correctly identified a few obvious ones (like the **sun, moon, turtle, shark** etc.), but it also had errors and was incomplete. For instance, five glyphs were glossed as *“porcelain”* which baffled later researchers until they realized Metoro meant **cowrie shells** (called *porcelaine* in French). So early attempts got some pictographs right and some wrong. Today, we refine this by cross-referencing multiple sources: our lexicon entries (compiled from Barthel, Fischer, Pozdniakov, Guy, etc.) assign confidence levels to each glyph’s proposed meaning based on how consistently that interpretation fits across texts and whether multiple scholars (and Rapa Nui informants) concur. This multi-source cross-check is crucial, since a glyph might deceptively look like one thing but mean another (e.g. a **turtle glyph** might be literal or might be a clan name “Turtle”). **In summary, treating Rongorongo signs as pictures gives us an initial dictionary of likely words, which is a foundation for deeper linguistic analysis.**

## Linguistic and Cultural Context: Rapa Nui Language Clues and Content Hypotheses

Because Rongorongo was almost certainly created by the Rapa Nui people, the **Polynesian language and culture** of Easter Island is our next layer of cross-reference. Decipherers have tried to match glyph sequences to words or phrases in Old Rapanui (reconstructed from early colonial era recordings). This is tricky – as noted, modern Rapa Nui has mixed with Tahitian and evolved, and the script might encode a chant or esoteric register not identical to everyday speech. Nonetheless, there are promising leads:

* Some glyph compounds appear in **formulaic patterns** that resemble Polynesian oral literature. For example, Steven R. Fischer identified a repeating three-part formula on the long *Santiago Staff* text (tablet I) that reminded him of a Rapanui creation chant structure. In Rapa Nui oral chants, a common construction is *“X ki ai ki roto ki Y, ka pu te Z”* (meaning “X by copulating with Y produced Z”). Fischer knew of a chant called **Atua Matariri** (recorded by Thomson from the recitations of Ure Va'e Iko, an islander) which lists a series of such procreative events. By aligning a staff sequence **606-76-700-8** with this pattern, he read it as: **MANU (bird) + hand + phallus, FISH, SUN**, which he translated to Rapanui *te manu mau ki ‘ai ki te ika, ka pu te ra’a* – **“All the birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth the sun.”**. This was remarkably similar to one verse in the actual chant (where a *land* copulates with a fish to produce the sun). Fischer took this as evidence that the staff contains a **creation myth** encoded in a phonetic-rebus manner, and he boldly announced in 1995 that he had **“cracked” Rongorongo** with this discovery.

  *Multi-method insight:* Fischer’s attempt brilliantly combined **linguistic pun (mau = plural)**, **Polynesian grammar**, and **mythology**. He identified glyph 6 (the hand) as a plural marker because Rapanui *ma’u* (“to take”) sounds like Tahitian *mau* (plural marker), and he guessed the script used a semantic shift from “hand” → “take” → a phonetic *mau* to indicate plural. Using that, 606 became “all birds” (bird + plural hand). He then read the phallus as “copulated” and fish (ika) as itself, yielding the phrase above. This creative phonetic wordplay is *controversial*, but it exemplifies out-of-the-box thinking necessary for decipherment – treating glyphs not just as logograms but as hints to **sounds or grammatical markers** via the acrophonic principle or rebus principle.

* **Cultural content expectations:** We also cross-reference what types of texts Polynesian societies valued. Easter Island’s limited resources and strong oral tradition suggest that if they went through the trouble of carving writing, it was for important content: *genealogies of chiefs, religious chants, cosmological stories, navigational or calendrical knowledge*, etc. Indeed, many researchers suspect **genealogical lists** are present. Butinov and Knorozov noticed the lack of frequent grammatical particles (like *te, he* for “the” in Rapanui) in the texts, which could mean either the language isn’t standard Polynesian or that the texts are written in a condensed **telegraphic style** focusing on content words (names, nouns, verbs). Such telegraphic style would fit a mnemonic device for priests who already knew the oral story – e.g. writing just “Turtle – phallus – Man – phallus – Shark – phallus – Man…” as a shorthand for “Turtle begat Man, Shark begat Man…” and so on (a hypothetical lineage or myth). In fact, one line that Butinov & Knorozov thought might be a **genealogy** (on tablet G) would, under Fischer’s sexual reading, bizarrely mean “turtle copulated with man to produce turtle; shark copulated with man to produce shark…”. That doesn’t make mythological sense, but it *does* make sense if we interpret it as a lineage: perhaps clans named Turtle and Shark, with a common ancestor (the man glyph, possibly representing a person or an event), and the result being continuation of those clans. This illustrates how **perspective of the time** matters – a 19th-century islander might have conceptualized lineage in terms of symbolic ancestors (totem animals) and “begatting,” which could be literally described with turtle/man phallus combinations on the tablet. What looks bizarre to us might be a poetic way of encoding descent or alliance in their culture.

* **Known Rapa Nui chants and myths:** Cross-referencing actual Rapa Nui (and related Polynesian) myth texts has been fruitful. The creation chant *Atua Matariri* we discussed is one example. Another is the myth of **Makemake (creator god)** trying to create humans by mating with various elements. That myth was recorded in Rapa Nui folklore and even has parallels in Mangarevan tradition. When Fischer found sequences like “sun copulates with fish” on the staff, he pointed to a Mangarevan chant where Tiki (analogous to Makemake) mates with a fish to create the sun. It turned out Fischer relied on an English translation that was a bit off (the original Rapanui verse was about the moon and darkness producing the sun, not birds or fish). Still, the general idea of **procreation myths** was validated – it’s likely some tablets are ritual chants listing how various gods/elements combined to produce new things (a very Polynesian motif).

  Similarly, Thomson in 1886 managed to coax Ure Va’e Iko – one of the last living islanders who had been *taught* Rongorongo in youth – to recite chants for a few tablets. Ure was reluctant (fearful of church prohibition) and possibly inebriated, but he did provide several *rongo-rongo chants*, which were written down. These include **“Apai”**, **“Atua Matariri”**, **“Ka ihi uiga”**, **“Eaha to rani ariiki Kete”**, and **“Ate ā Renga Hōkau iti Poheraa”**, each supposedly corresponding to a specific tablet. The unfortunate part: Salmon’s translations of these recitations were rough and even intermingled Tahitian and modern terms (one contains phrases like “the French flag” and “give money” – obviously not original to pre-missionary times!). This suggests Ure might have been mixing in contemporary references or intentionally garbling the content. In one case, the *Mamari tablet’s* recited chant (*Ate ā Renga Hōkau iti Poheraa*) was thought to be a love song, but it included Tahitian words (e.g. *poheraa* for “death” instead of pure Rapanui *matenga*), casting doubt on its authenticity as the tablet’s text.

  **However**, even if Ure’s readings are not literal translations of the tablets, they might preserve the *genre* or theme associated with each tablet. It could be that certain tablets were known to contain a certain story or hymn, and Ure recited what he remembered of that story (embellished or censored). Thus, researchers use these as clues: Mamari’s associated chant title mentions *poheraa* (death) and sounds like a narrative or song, which might hint the non-calendar side of Mamari tablet contains a *legend or lament*. Two other tablets’ chants recorded by Ure have titles including *ariiki* (ariki = chief) and other terms suggesting perhaps genealogies of kings or an origin legend. By cross-referencing these **oral texts** with glyph patterns, one can test hypotheses. For example, if tablet *E Keiti* was read as “Apai” (a chant possibly about abundance or yams), do we see lots of plant glyphs on Keiti? If so, that might not be coincidence. Indeed, Fedorova’s attempt (1990s) at direct translation yielded a lot of agricultural terms (yams, taro, etc.) in one tablet, which was dismissed as nonsense by others – but intriguingly, if a tablet were a *yam planting chant*, maybe that list of tubers wasn’t entirely crazy after all (though Fedorova’s restrictive one-glyph one-word method made everything *only* about roots and got mocked as “worthy of a maniac”). The lesson: **cultural context and language can suggest plausible content**, but without a systematic reading method, it’s easy to mislead ourselves into either over-translation (as Fedorova did) or misidentification (as Fischer did in parts).

In sum, the linguistic approach urges us to cross-reference **Polynesian languages**, looking for consistent phonetic or semantic links. It also requires caution: as some critics note, if Rongorongo were a straightforward writing of Rapanui language, we should see very frequent short glyphs corresponding to articles or prepositions (like *te, he, ki*). The fact we do not suggests either a non-Polynesian language (unlikely, given all evidence of Rapa Nui origins) or more plausibly a unique writing convention – perhaps a mnemonic shorthand where such particles are omitted and only content words or syllables are written. This **telegraphic** possibility aligns with how someone in that time might encode a chant: assume the reader already knows the grammar and just needs the key nouns/verbs to jog memory. Understanding this perspective can help modern decipherers focus on matching glyph sequences to likely *meaningful phrases* rather than expecting a one-to-one spelling of spoken sentences.

## Out-of-the-Box Cross-References with Other Scripts

In our multi-method arsenal, we also consider comparing Rongorongo with other **entirely separate scripts or symbol systems**. At first glance, this seems far-fetched – Easter Island is geographically isolated, and the script is probably an independent invention. However, the idea that similar symbols might carry similar meanings across cultures has tempted researchers for over a century. One famous attempt was by Hungarian researcher **Vilmos Hevesy (Guillaume de Hevesy)** in 1932. He noticed superficial shape resemblances between Rongorongo glyphs and signs of the **Indus Valley script** (another undeciphered script from ancient India, 4000 years older). Despite the enormous separations in time and space (the Indus script died out by \~1500 BC and is half a world away), Hevesy’s comparison was intriguing enough that it was presented to the French Academy and even prompted an expedition to Easter Island to investigate. Ultimately, this **Indus-Rongorongo connection** was debunked – many of Hevesy’s illustrated “matches” turned out to be erroneous (some Rongorongo glyphs he drew didn’t even exist in the corpus) and the remaining similarities were deemed coincidental. As later analysts quipped, comparing two undeciphered scripts with no intermediary is not a productive route; it led to a dead end and is now viewed as a historical curiosity.

Nonetheless, the exercise wasn’t entirely in vain. It underscored that Rongorongo glyphs are *pictographic enough* that one can see parallels anywhere if one looks hard – a cautionary tale for cross-referencing. It also highlighted the need for rigorous method: similar form does not equal related function unless supported by context. We keep this in mind when we **“look outside the box.”** For example, we might note that *many ancient scripts use a circle with rays for “sun”*, or a crescent for “moon”, or wavy lines for “water”. Such cross-script commonalities bolster our confidence in those particular glyph readings (since humans often independently invent the same symbol for the same concept) but they **do not prove a historical link**.

Another cross-reference occasionally floated is with **Mayan hieroglyphs** or other Mesoamerican writing, since some early theorists speculated a South American or migratory contact. These too have been dismissed as coincidental or fringe. Alan Carroll in 1892 even claimed Rongorongo was written in a mix of Peruvian (Quechua) and Mesoamerican languages by a legendary “Long-Ear” people – a highly fanciful idea that never provided a coherent reading. Such theories are now regarded as part of the *“lunatic fringe”* of Rongorongo studies.

A more grounded cross-comparison is within Polynesia itself: **no other Polynesian culture had an indigenous script** (as far as we know), but they did have rich symbol systems like petroglyphs, tattoos, and the use of mnemonic knots or carved staffs. By comparing Rapa Nui’s script with, say, Hawaiian petroglyph motifs or Tahitian tattoo motifs, we might glean if certain symbols (turtle, human, bird, etc.) carry similar mythic meanings across Polynesia. Also, the structure of Rongorongo text (if it is poetic or list-like) can be compared to how Polynesian oral chants are constructed (e.g. parallelism, repetition, use of fixed epithets). This *stylistic* cross-reference has indeed been used by Jacques Guy and others. Guy analyzed the Mamari calendar text alongside other Polynesian lunar calendar recitations to see if the pattern of named nights matches – and it does align in grouping (the Rapa Nui calendar nights were grouped in a unique way, reflecting a one-off divergence after isolation, but still recognizable as Polynesian).

In summary, **thinking outside the box** by comparing across disciplines and cultures can yield creative hypotheses, but they must be verified within Rongorongo’s own context. The Indus script comparison, for example, ultimately offered no decipherment progress, but comparing Rapa Nui’s calendar glyphs with other island calendars did *confirm* the interpretation. The key is to cross-check any wild theory against hard evidence in the texts.

## Notable Attempts and Progress So Far

Over the years, numerous scholars have contributed pieces to the Rongorongo puzzle using the above methods (and sometimes very unique ones). Here we cross-reference some notable decipherment attempts and what they taught us:

* **Father Jaussen & Metoro (1860s-70s):** The first to record any glyph interpretations. They assigned words to many glyphs by having Metoro Tau’a Ure supposedly “read” tablets A, B, C, E. This yielded the **Jaussen list** of glyph meanings. While not a true decipherment, it identified obvious pictographs (sun, moon, turtle, etc.) and provided chants (though likely unrelated) for two tablets. It showed that some glyphs correspond to Rapanui words (e.g. *rā* for sun, *marama* for moon possibly), but Metoro’s inconsistent reading order (he infamously read one side of a tablet in reverse direction) indicated he was not actually decoding the script. Instead, he recited memorized litanies keyed loosely to the symbols. The Jaussen effort, once hoped to be a “Rosetta Stone,” ultimately did not unlock the script, but those initial glyph glosses remain reference points (with corrections, like “cowrie shell” for the earlier mistranslated “porcelain”).

* **Butinov & Knorozov (1950s):** These Russian scholars performed the first rigorous **statistical analysis** of Rongorongo. They concluded either the language wasn’t Polynesian or it was written in a compressed style lacking grammatical particles. Importantly, they hypothesized some structural roles: for example, they noticed glyph 76 often attached to figures and suggested it might mark personal names (like a patronymic suffix). They also identified one line that might be a genealogy (the Gv line discussed). Their work introduced the idea that *Rongorongo might not be a straightforward syllabic spelling*, but possibly a mixed or logographic system – an insight that guided later researchers. They did tentatively assign a few values (ariki for a chief glyph, etc.), drawing on Polynesian parallels, but they did not claim a full decipherment.

* **Thomas Barthel (1950s-60s):** Barthel catalogued all glyphs (assigning them numbers) and transcribed each tablet into a numerical sequence, publishing this foundational corpus in 1958. He proposed the identification of the **Mamari lunar calendar** (correctly recognizing the 30-part structure and even linking many of the Rapa Nui night names). Barthel also suspected certain texts were genealogical and noted the repeating patterns. While Barthel didn’t decipher the script, his systematic approach and glyph list are the basis of nearly all modern studies. He unfortunately treated all variants as separate numbers, which later analysts had to revise, but his work allowed meaningful discussion of texts for the first time. Barthel’s identification of some glyphs (e.g. the frigatebird glyph as *MANU* bird, and male/female symbols for glyphs 200/300 as *ariki* and *va’ine* perhaps) came from contextual analysis and remain plausible.

* **Russian Team (Fedorova, 1960s-80s):** Irina Fedorova took a logographic approach, attempting to assign a single Rapanui word to each glyph and then read the texts straight off as if each glyph = one word. She published translations for several tablets. Unfortunately, as noted earlier, the results were gibberish: for example, she “translated” the Mamari calendar lines as a litany of yam and sweet potato varieties with repetitive verbs (“he cut, he dug, a yam, a yam…” endlessly). Even she admitted one text sounded like nonsense. Her methodology ignored ligatures and allographs (treating, say, glyph 6 vs 64 as different words, when they’re actually the same sign form), leading to extreme repetitive output. The takeaway from Fedorova’s attempt is that **Rongorongo is unlikely to be purely logographic with one glyph = one word** – that yields untenable redundancy. It must have a more complex system (either combining glyphs for words, or glyphs representing syllables/phonetics that combine to form words). However, Fedorova’s work was “more rigorous than most” in that she did limit glyphs to one value and tried to stick to Rapanui vocabulary. It failed key tests (no mention of “moon” in a presumed calendar text, for example), but it provided a cautionary dataset. Her identification of about 130 basic glyphs (and Pozdniakov’s further collapsing to \~120 with allographs) tells us roughly the script’s size: on the order of 120–150 symbols, which is comparable to a syllabary or a logosyllabic system, but too few for a pure logography of a whole language.

* **Steven Roger Fischer (1990s):** Fischer’s claim of decipherment (discussed above with the “bird copulated with fish” example) is the most high-profile in recent times. He published *Rongorongo: The Easter Island Script* (1997) detailing his theory that **85% of the corpus consists of creation chants of the form X–phallus Y Z** (X copulates with Y to produce Z). He argued that later texts abbreviated these and omitted the phallus, but were essentially the same type of content. Fischer deserves credit for identifying the *Atua Matariri* connection and proposing a phonetic element (the *ma’u/mau* plural idea). However, his decipherment has not been accepted by other experts. Several **objections** were raised:

  * Statistical checks showed the pattern isn’t as pervasive as claimed: on the Staff, barely half the sequences fit the exact “triplet” format when scrutinized, and glyph 76 sometimes appears where it shouldn’t if the pattern were strict. In other texts, the phallic triplets are even rarer.
  * Pozdniakov pointed out that by focusing on just four glyphs (bird, phallus, fish, sun), which make up \~20% of the entire corpus, one can cherry-pick many instances that look like “sun copulates with fish” etc. If one applies Fischer’s logic broadly, it leads to *chaos*: nearly *everything* would be copulating with everything else in various lines, producing nonsensical combinations. In fact, one could find sequences where “the sun copulates with the fish” or “fish with birds” simply by chance arrangement of those common glyphs. Fischer didn’t address why *those* would not count.
  * The linguistic basis was shaky: the plural *mau* doesn’t exist in Rapanui (it’s Tahitian). Even if it did, in Polynesian grammar a plural word *mau* placed after a noun means “true, genuine” not plural – so reading a suffix hand as plural is grammatically questionable.
  * The supposed myth of “birds copulating with fish to produce the sun” is not attested in Rapa Nui lore. Fischer’s attempt to cite a verse of the chant was based on a misinterpreted translation; the actual verse mentions the moon and darkness, not birds or fish. So the parallel was forced.
  * Applying Fischer’s scheme to what are likely genealogical lines made them absurd (as noted, turtle copulating with man to produce turtle, etc.).
  * Computational linguist Richard Sproat tested Fischer’s idea by removing all 76 “phallus” symbols from the corpus to see if the Staff text would then show similarity to other tablets (i.e. if others were the same phrases but minus the phallus). The result: no increase in matches – the Staff still stood alone, meaning other tablets didn’t secretly hide the same patterns without the phallus. This is strong evidence against Fischer’s notion that most tablets are abbreviated creation chants akin to the Staff.
    In short, Fischer’s work was valuable in energizing research and highlighting one possible narrative (creation myths). It gave us plausible identifications like confirming glyph 76 *is* indeed a phallus (few dispute that now) and glyph 8 likely *ra’a* (sun), glyph 700 *ika* (fish). But as a full decipherment, it fails the **acid test**: it doesn’t apply cleanly across all texts or allow us to read a new inscription with confidence. The scholarly consensus is that Fischer “overstated” one pattern and prematurely declared success. However, elements of his approach (searching for linguistic patterns, using mythology as a key, recognizing grammatical markers) remain part of the multi-method toolkit.

* **Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov (2000s):** Father-son researchers in Russia (Konstantin and Igor Pozdniakov) have been at the forefront of rigorous analysis in recent decades. By cleaning up Barthel’s glyph inventory (identifying which were mere variants or ligatures), they reduced noise in the data. Their discovery of extensive **shared phrases** and formulaic structure across tablets, as discussed earlier, is one of the most important contributions. It implies we can focus decipherment on those repeated sequences. Moreover, Jacques Guy and the Pozdniakovs both explored the possibility of **syllabic or phonetic elements**. For example, in the Mamari lunar calendar, seven of the crescents have small extra glyphs next to them, which Guy theorized might represent syllables hinting at the **names of those nights**. Polynesian lunar nights have specific names; perhaps those little glyphs are rebus clues (e.g. a picture of a **bird (manu)** might stand for the night called *Kokore* “broken” if that word sounds like *manu* in Rapanui – just hypothetical example). Guy tried some syllabic readings of accompanying signs and found some correspondences to recorded names. The Pozdniakovs likewise have looked for consistent pairings that might indicate phonetic complements. This partial phonetic approach is promising because it could explain how a limited set of \~120 base glyphs could encode a much larger vocabulary (through combinations or phonetic determinatives, similar to how Maya or Egyptian writing works).

  While a full phonetic decipherment hasn’t been achieved, the **inventory revision** and phrase analyses by Pozdniakov have moved the field forward significantly. They have not claimed to “read” the tablets outright, but they have essentially mapped out the grammar of Rongorongo texts: how often things repeat, in what order, which glyphs cluster, etc. Any future decipherment will undoubtedly build on that framework.

* **Modern Tools (Computer Analysis, 3D Scans, etc.):** In the very latest efforts, digital humanities have joined the fray. For instance, 3D modeling of tablets (to better see eroded glyphs) and computer algorithms to detect pattern frequencies or possible acrophonic clues are being applied. One 2014 study by G. Berthin attempted a qualitative/quantitative validation of glyph strings by analyzing a recently discovered artifact with Rongorongo-like inscriptions (the “Mamari Fisherman’s Inscription”). Others like Richard Sproat used computer programs to test hypotheses like Fischer’s (as mentioned, by doing automatic string matching and removals). So far, computers have confirmed the highly patterned nature of texts but have not “solved” them – which is expected, since decipherment is more than brute force. However, computational cross-referencing is helping by processing the corpus rapidly to spot non-obvious parallels or to simulate how a proposed reading would play out across all texts (a good way to shoot down inconsistent theories).

In summary, **no one has fully deciphered Rongorongo yet**, but each approach and cross-comparison has shed light on pieces of the puzzle. We now have a partial *lexicon* of likely glyph meanings (especially for natural objects, celestial bodies, and some actions), a grasp of text structure (repeating segments, probable genealogy and chant formats), and at least one clear content segment (the lunar calendar of Mamari). The ultimate solution will likely require **synthesizing all these methods**: identifying the script’s likely **underlying language** (almost certainly Old Rapanui, a Polynesian tongue), determining how that language is represented (logograms, syllables, or a mix), and confirming it against the known culture/historical context of what the islanders would write about.

## Conclusion: Toward a Comprehensive Decipherment

The ongoing research into Rongorongo demonstrates the importance of a **multi-method, cross-referenced strategy**. By examining the Mamari tablet’s calendar in conjunction with Polynesian lunar lore, by comparing texts internally for recurring patterns and across cultures for shared iconography, and by testing linguistic hypotheses against the realities of Rapa Nui culture, we gradually narrow down the possibilities. Decipherment is like assembling a giant jigsaw – the edges (numerical patterns, repeats, obvious pictographs) are mostly in place; the challenge is filling the middle with a coherent picture. We must remain open to “outside the box” ideas (e.g. perhaps Rongorongo isn’t a full writing system but a mnemonic device – a *proto-writing* used only by trained chanters). If we put ourselves in the shoes of a 18th-century Rapanui priest or scholar, we might ask: *What knowledge is so important to record, and how would I encode it with the tools and symbols at hand?* The answers point to **genealogies of kings, origin myths of gods and tribes, agricultural and astrological cycles, ritual chants for fertility or navigation**. Indeed, those themes appear repeatedly in the clues we’ve decoded: the genealogy-like structures, the creation and procreation sequences, the lunar calendar for planting or ceremony timing.

Future breakthroughs might come from finding a forgotten translation key (a genuine bilingual text or a hidden reading instruction), or from iterative analysis using larger Polynesian textual comparisons. Until then, researchers will continue using every available angle. As we’ve seen with the Mamari tablet, even a single line of glyphs could only be understood by **cross-referencing astronomy, ethnography, linguistics, and visual analysis all at once** – no single-method would have cracked it. The decipherment of Rongorongo will likely emerge the same way: piece by piece, each validated by crossing multiple sources of evidence.

In conclusion, while full decipherment remains *elusive*, the multi-disciplinary, cross-referential approach has already illuminated significant portions of Rongorongo’s mystery. By deep-diving into tablets like Mamari and comparing glyphs across the corpus and beyond, we are essentially learning to “listen” to the echoes of the lost Rapa Nui voice. Each glyph that we link to a word or concept is a step closer to hearing what those wooden tablets have been silently preserving for centuries – the knowledge and stories of a people isolated in the vast Pacific, yet connected to us through the universal human impulse to record and remember.
