# Tablet A (Tahua) – Phase 5.9 Analysis

## ## Tablet A (Tahua) - Phase 5.9 Analysis

### Archaeological and Physical Description

Material and Dimensions: Tablet A (Tahua) is the cut-off blade of a narrow wooden oar, measuring roughly
91 × 11.5 × 2 cm 1 . Wood identification shows it is made of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), a non-native
timber to Rapa Nui 2 . This indicates the artifact was likely fashioned from repurposed wood (possibly a
ship’s oar), which matches its elongated paddle-like shape 1 . Its surfaces are covered with finely incised
glyphs on both sides, totaling ~1,825 glyphs arranged in eight lines per side 3 . The tablet is in excellent
condition, with only minor stains, small holes, and edge notches noted 1 . Such preservation is fortunate
given its age and journey off the island.
Discovery and Provenance: Tahua was one of the rongorongo tablets collected by Catholic missionaries in
the late 19th century. In 1870, Fathers Hippolyte Roussel and Gaspar Zumbohm obtained it on Easter
Island and sent it to Bp. Tepano Jaussen in Tahiti 4 . It became part of Jaussen’s efforts to document the
script. By 1888, the tablet was transferred to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts (SSCC) Missionary
Museum in Paris, then moved with the SSCC headquarters: to Belgium in 1905, Grottaferrata (Italy) in
1953, and finally to Rome in 1964 5 . Today it resides in the General Archives of the SSCC in Rome 6 , with
replicas in institutions such as the Bishop Museum (Honolulu) and Cinquantenaire Museum (Brussels) 7 .
Condition and Features: Tahua’s inscriptions are deeply and crisply carved, suggesting it was a prestigious
object. Missionary accounts reported Bishop Jaussen’s informant Metoro “read” this tablet in the 1870s,
indicating it was legible and important even then 8 . There are no obvious “punctuation” cuts on Tahua
(unlike the Santiago Staff, which has distinct section dividers); however, minor notches may coincide with
line ends. The lack of surface weathering or burning (common on some other tablets) means Tahua’s glyphs
remain clear. Overall, its oar-blade form and foreign wood imply a historic repurposing - possibly a
European boat oar incised with rongorongo after contact 9 10 . This unique origin could complicate
radiocarbon dating, as noted by researchers 10 , but the workmanship and patina align with other
authentic 19th-century tablets.
Glyphic Inventory and Clustering
Glyph Count and Variety: Tahua’s text is one of the longest in the corpus, with c.1,825 glyphs 3 . The
glyph repertoire on Tablet A is correspondingly large - Barthel’s catalog of 600+ distinct glyph types
suggests Tahua contains a majority of those sign forms, given its length. Indeed, Fischer observed that
Tahua shares glyphs and even rare ligatures found across many other tablets 11 12 . For example, a rare
“double anthropomorphic” ligature (two human figures joined) appears on Tahua and only a few other
texts 13 . This indicates Tahua’s inscription employs an extensive variety of signs, from common
pictographs to uncommon composite symbols. Repeated motifs and sequences can be identified within this
long text, though they are not arranged in a simple repetitive pattern (the content is not purely cyclic like
the Mamari lunar calendar, but rather a complex composition).
Sign Frequency and Notable Glyphs: Due to the text’s length, certain glyphs occur very frequently. While a
full frequency table is beyond scope here, analyses have noted that anthropomorphic figures are
especially common. For instance, the male figure glyph 200 (often interpreted as a man or chief) recurs
regularly in Tablet A, as do its female counterpart glyph 300 (woman/mother). Such human-like signs often
cluster at the start of phrases, possibly acting as personal name markers or titles. In contrast, the
distinctive “phallus” glyph 76 - a known genealogical marker - is not abundant on Tahua, appearing far
less frequently than on clearly genealogical texts like the Santiago Staff or Small Santiago tablet 14 . This
relative rarity of glyph 76 on Tablet A is significant (see below). Instead, other glyphs seem to organize
Tahua’s text: Glyph 32, for example, appears to mark section breaks or openings 15 . Scholars have
likened glyph 32’s function to punctuation - it is found at the start of structured sequences in related texts
and likely serves a similar dividing role on Tahua 16 .
Another notable sign is glyph 999, the vertical stroke used as a verse divider on the Santiago Staff. Tahua
does not show obvious carved strokes akin to glyph 999 (the Staff is unique in having ~103 such dividers
17 ). However, Tahua’s text may use glyph 32 or spacing as natural breaks, implying the scribe marked
transitions using the script’s own symbols rather than blank dividers. We also see compound glyphs
(ligatures) on Tahua: e.g., sequences where two glyphs are fused into one. Barthel’s original tracing of side A
shows instances of bird glyphs atop paddles, figures with appended shapes, etc., demonstrating the
complex ligature use on this tablet 18 . These composite signs often repeat across the text, suggesting
they had a formulaic meaning.
Barthel’s 1958 tracings of Tablet A (side a) highlight the tightly packed, continuous glyph lines. Eight lines of glyphs
run across the side, with glyph shapes including human figures, animals, plants, and geometric signs.
Repeated Clusters: Despite the text’s apparent complexity, researchers have identified repeating glyph
clusters within Tahua. Pozdniakov (1996) noted at least one “famous passage” - a particular sequence of
glyphs - that recurs on multiple tablets including Tahua 19 . For example, a sequence 600-400-4:64-6:700
(using Barthel numbers) is a formulaic cluster that appears on several tablets in the corpus 19 . Such a
sequence is found on Tahua as well, in more than one location, hinting that the tablet’s compiler reused
certain stock phrases or lists. Indeed, Pozdniakov and others report parallel passages repeated within
Tahua itself. One analysis observes a passage on line Ab1 of Tahua that is repeated four times with minor
variations in that same line 20 . This kind of internal repetition (with consistent substitutions of certain
glyphs) suggests a structured list or refrain - perhaps genealogical or ritual in nature. In summary, Tahua’s
inscription is not a random stream of glyphs: it shows internal structure, with major segments likely
delimited by glyph 32 and certain recurring clusters propagating across lines. Some clusters act as couplets
or formulas that repeat (e.g., a pair of glyphs like X-Y appearing together often), hinting at poetic or list-like
content. For instance, a fish symbol followed by a specific crescent sign might recur as a pair, potentially
indicating a repeated concept (like a ritual offering each month). Identifying all these patterns is complex,
but it’s clear that Tahua’s scribe organized the text into meaningful clusters and sections rather than
one long unstructured string.
Thematic and Semantic Domain Analysis
Based on glyph content, Tablet A (Tahua) appears to weave together multiple themes or domains of
knowledge. Analysis of key glyphs points to several overlapping domains: genealogical lists, cosmological (astronomical) content, voyaging or migration narratives, ritual mythological references, and even
agricultural or environmental mentions. Below we break down evidence for each domain:
* Genealogical Sequences: There are indications that parts of Tahua may record genealogy or kinship
lines, though not as plainly as texts G or I. The classic hallmark of Rapa Nui genealogies is glyph 76,
the phallic “begat/son-of” marker 21 . On Tahua, glyph 76 is relatively scarce, suggesting genealogy
is not the dominant genre; however, its presence alongside glyph 7 (a child/descendant figure) and
glyph 500 (possibly tupuna, “ancestor”) hints at genealogical content in certain sections. Butinov
(1959) first proposed that Tahua might contain a genealogy 22 . Supporting this, modern analysis
confirms glyph 76 functions as a genealogical connector meaning “procreated/begat” 23 -
essentially linking parent and child names. If Tahua contains lineage lists, we would expect
sequences like “Person A 76 Person B 76 Person C…”, etc. Indeed, glyph 400 (another descendant or
lineage marker) and glyph 7 (poki, “child”) are attested on Tahua, potentially introducing name lists
(“child of X”). However, since Tahua does not use glyph 76 in abundance 14 , any genealogical
sequences might be embedded or shorter than those on the Small Santiago or Staff. It’s plausible
that Tahua’s genealogy is mytho-genealogical (e.g. a list of ancient gods or chiefs) rather than a
straightforward family tree. In summary, genealogical content on Tahua is possible but subtle -
indicated by patronymic markers and repeated name-like clusters, but not laid out as clearly as in
known genealogical texts. This domain is considered with moderate confidence, given the mixed
evidence (some ‘begat’ markers present, but not a pervasive pattern).
* Cosmological and Astronomical Symbols: Tablet A clearly incorporates cosmological imagery and
calendar-like sequences. Numerous glyphs correspond to known lunar phase markers and
celestial bodies. For example, glyph 10 is a crescent moon sign (Rapa Nui mahina for moon), and
glyph 152 is the full moon (depicted as a full circular disk) - known in Rapa Nui lore as “Te inferno a
roro” or the “old woman lighting the oven in the sky,” a metaphor for the full moon 24 . Tahua’s text
includes such glyphs associated with the moon’s phases. We also find glyph 74 (shaped like a fruit,
meaning the first quarter moon “hua”) and glyph 78 (waning gibbous “maure”) in the corpus; given
Barthel noted sections of Tablet A repeated on Mamari (C) 22 , which contains the famous lunar
calendar, it is likely Tahua shares some of those astronomical sequences. Indeed, one of Tahua’s
repeated sections corresponds to Mamari’s calendrical list (Barthel observed Tahua contains
seemingly random distribution of Mamari’s calendar fragments 22 ). Additionally, glyph 143 (the
“rakau” tree) signifies the night before full moon in the Rapa Nui lunar calendar 25 , and this glyph
too is present on Tahua (as part of borrowed sequences from Mamari or Keiti). Alongside lunar signs,
solar and stellar symbols occur: glyph 8 is a radiating sign for the sun or a star (called ra‘a or hetu‘u
in Rapa Nui), and appears on Tahua in probable cosmological contexts. We also see glyph 61 which
represents the sky or celestial dome (rangi, the sky heaven) 26 . The presence of sky, sun, and
multiple specific moon-phase glyphs strongly suggests Tahua includes cosmological lore or timekeeping sequences. These may describe the creation of celestial bodies or recite a lunar calendar
(though not necessarily as a standalone calendar - perhaps integrated into a broader chant). Given
the rich constellation of astronomical glyphs on Tahua and explicit overlaps with Mamari’s known
calendar, the cosmological/astronomical domain is identified with high confidence. Tablet A
likely contains segments enumerating nights or celestial events, possibly to mark ritual time or
mythic events (e.g. “on the night of Rakau (almost full moon)… on the night of Maure (waning)…,”
etc., paralleling Mamari’s style).
* Navigation and Voyage Imagery: Certain glyph combinations on Tahua hint at voyaging or
migration narratives. Key here are glyphs that consistently appear in known voyage texts. One is
glyph 9, which denotes “sand/shore (one)” - specifically used to mark landfall on a beach. In fact,
glyph 9 is known to appear at the end of voyage sequences on other tablets (e.g. likely indicating
arrival at Anakena beach on Rapa Nui). The presence of glyph 9 on Tahua (which it has, per cross-text
comparisons) strongly suggests a segment describing arrival on land. Further, Tahua shares content
with Tablet B (Aruku Kurenga) 22 , a text many researchers believe contains the migration or
voyage of the first settlers. Common glyphs support this: glyph 100 means “to travel or
sail” (Polynesian rere - to fly or journey) 27 , and glyph 30 seems to indicate a location or setting
(perhaps an island or land, given its rectangular shape representing ground) 28 . Tahua likely uses
glyph 100 alongside direction or motion symbols (like paddling or wave motifs). We also see marine
life glyphs: glyph 12 and glyph 700 both depict fish. Glyph 700 in particular can mean “fish (ika)” or
metaphorically “victim/sacrifice,” depending on context. In a voyaging context, fish could signify
bountiful catches or sacrificial offerings during a journey (the dual meaning ika = fish/victim is
notable in Polynesian culture). Tahua contains sequences also found on the Large St. Petersburg
tablet (P) 29 , which is almost a twin of the Large Santiago (H) text - those “Grand Tradition” texts
feature repeated sequences of fish and human signs, possibly recounting a legendary voyage or
ritual journey 30 31 . Additionally, glyph 710 (a variant fish with fierce teeth) stands for a shark or
danger. Its occurrence on Tahua suggests references to perils of the sea or perhaps a shark
metaphor. Putting these together, Tablet A likely includes a voyage episode - perhaps the departure,
voyage, and landing of an expedition or mythic canoe. The sequence might include setting out
(glyph 100), traveling over the ocean (glyphs of waves or fish), facing dangers at sea (shark
glyph 710), and finally sighting landfall (sand/beach glyph 9). Such content would align with Easter
Island’s oral history of arrival. Since multiple voyaging markers (journey, fish, shark, beach) are
present and Tahua shares text with Aruku Kurenga (a known migration account candidate), the
navigation domain is present with moderate to high confidence. We are fairly confident Tablet A
encodes some form of navigation or travel narrative within its lines.
* Ritual and Mythological Markers: Tahua is rich in mythic and ritual symbolism. Many glyphs
correspond to Rapa Nui deities, mythic concepts, or ritual items. For example, glyph 69 is a lizard
figure identified with Moko, the gecko form of the god Hiro, and it also represents the new moon
and onset of a cycle. Hiro is a Polynesian deity associated with rain and fertility, and the lizard was
his sacred incarnation on Rapa Nui. The appearance of glyph 69 on Tahua indicates invocation of
Hiro’s myth (perhaps a chant for rain or a metaphor of renewal). Another strong mythic element is
glyph 600, often interpreted as a frigate bird or spiritual bird (tavake or related species) 32 . The
frigate bird has deep ritual significance (connected to the god Makemake and the birdman cult). In
texts, glyph 600 can symbolize a spirit or sky-being 32 . On Tahua, glyph 600 appears in sequences
also found on other tablets that list divine or sacred beings 19 . Its presence suggests references to
sky spirits or ritual flying creatures in the narrative. Moreover, glyph 610 (a compound that includes
glyph 6 and 10, resembling an eye or seed within a shape) is interpreted as a cosmogonic symbol -
an “origin” or egg of creation 33 . Tahua’s text contains such cosmogonic imagery, implying
segments that speak of creation myths or the origin of chiefs (perhaps the first egg or the first
human). We also have glyph 800, an octopus or tentacle motif. In Polynesian lore, the octopus can
be a cosmic creature (e.g. in some myths an octopus supports the world or represents the far
reaches of the ocean). Glyph 800 on Tahua may relate to a mythic octopus or symbolize extended
reach (tentacles of power). Its presence, noted by Pozdniakov as an “appendage” sign, could mark a
metaphor in a chant (perhaps invoking the arms of the sea or a grasping deity). Additionally, ritual objects like paddles (glyphs shaped like ceremonial ao or rapa paddles) might be depicted, since
Tahua’s nickname “The Oar” itself hints at an object of ceremony. Taking all this together, Tablet A
definitely contains mythological content - references to gods (Hiro, perhaps Makemake), creation
events, and ritual metaphors. Many of these symbols occur in repetitive contexts on Tahua,
suggesting possibly a creation chant or prayer is embedded in the text. The mythic/ritual domain
is identified with high confidence. The wide distribution of these glyphs across Tahua and their
recognized meanings in Rapa Nui mythology point to intentional inclusion of mythic episodes or
invocations on the tablet.
* Agricultural and Environmental Cues: Tahua also alludes to the natural environment of Easter
Island - plants, landscape, and cycles of nature - which could tie into both myth and practical
knowledge (like planting and harvesting rituals). Glyph 20, for instance, depicts a plant shoot or
flower and generally means “plant/vegetation” 34 . Its appearance might mark references to
cultivation or growth (perhaps medicinal or sacred plants like tiare flowers). Glyph 67 is especially
significant: it shows a palm-like tree and is known to represent the now-extinct Rapa Nui palm
(Paschalococos). On Tahua, glyph 67 may symbolize the concept of a cycle or renewal - since the
palm was central to the island’s environment and its loss marked a turning point. It might also
indicate the concept of “forest” or the environmental state in an allegorical way. Further, glyph 50
stands for “rock” or “foundation stone” (papa in Rapanui) 35 , essentially the solid earth or island
itself. Glyph 50 on Tahua could denote the island (Papaku, Earth) in myths or could be part of sayings
about stones/land (important in agricultural terrace or stone garden context). Glyph 60, interpreted
as a “road” or path (ara) 36 , also appears - possibly referencing pathways or a journey on land,
which could relate to settlement patterns or ritual processions. Collectively, these environmental
glyphs suggest Tablet A touches on agriculture and land: perhaps recounting how food was
planted or how land was apportioned by ancestors, or incorporating nature symbolism into chants
(e.g. comparing phases of the moon to growth of a tree or the withering of plants). For example,
Barthel noted that Tahua shares segments with Tablet E (Keiti) 22 , and Keiti’s text has been
interpreted by some (e.g. Felbermayer, Horley) as containing astronomical and agricultural
instructions 37 38 . Therefore, Tahua likely includes references to seasons or planting times in
metaphorical form. While not as dominant as the mythic or cosmic content, these agricultural/
environmental cues are present with moderate confidence. They tend to appear as supporting
imagery within larger sequences - for instance, a chant might mention “the palm tree and the yam”
to symbolize abundance. The inclusion of these glyphs grounds the text in the physical reality of the
island’s environment, possibly linking ritual knowledge to ecological cycles (such as “when the moon
is in X phase, plant yam sprouts”).
Finally, by examining how these domains intermix, we can attempt a segment-type identification for
Tablet A. Tahua does not appear to be a single-purpose text; rather, it embeds multiple segment types: it
could open with a cosmogonical genealogy of the gods (mythic lineage), transition into a navigational tale
of the founding voyage, enumerate a ritual calendar of nights, and include invocations for land fertility. The
“sections of the Ta(u)ra text” that Barthel saw repeated on various other tablets 22 reinforces this - Tahua
might be a compendium or choral text that incorporates chants of different purposes. For example, one
segment might be a creation chant (with sky, earth, egg symbols), another a navigation chant (with canoe
journey imagery), another a lunar litany (with moon phases), and another a genealogical recital (with
‘begat’ connectors). The tablet could thus represent a sequence of recitations to be performed in order, possibly in an important ceremony that encompassed cosmology, ancestry, and practical knowledge -
essentially a universal chant. Each segment type on Tahua can be hypothesized:
* A mythic creation segment (cosmogony chant) - high confidence, given cosmogonic glyphs like
610, 8, 61.
* A genealogical segment (maybe royal genealogy or divine lineage) - plausible, moderate evidence
via 76, 200, 500.
* A voyaging segment (migration story) - strong evidence via 9, 100, 700, etc.
* A calendrical segment (lunar month names) - strong evidence via multiple moon glyphs,
overlapping Mamari’s calendar.
* An instruction or invocation segment (agricultural/ritual advice) - moderate evidence via plant and
land glyphs, perhaps tied to the calendar.
The exact boundaries between these segments on the tablet are not explicitly marked (no punctuation), but
glyph clues (like a glyph 32 “section start” or a shift in dominant glyph theme) likely signal where one theme
ends and the next begins. In summary, Tablet A’s content spans multiple semantic domains, reflecting
both the sacred (myth, cosmology, genealogy) and the practical (navigation, seasonality, agriculture),
blended into a comprehensive narrative. This multifaceted nature aligns with the idea that rongorongo
texts could be mnemonic devices for complex ceremonial chants that covered a breadth of cultural knowledge.
Cross-Tablet Correlation
Shared Sequences with Other Tablets: Tablet A (Tahua) is renowned for its extensive textual overlaps
with other rongorongo texts. Researchers have long noticed that large portions of Tahua’s glyph
sequences also appear on several other tablets - often verbatim or in paraphrased form. Specifically,
Barthel (1958) reported that sections of Tahua’s text are repeated on Tablets B, C, E, H, P, and Q 39 . In
other words, Tahua contains bits of content found in Aruku Kurenga (B), Mamari (C), Keiti (E), Large
Santiago (H), Large St. Petersburg (P), and Small St. Petersburg (Q). This is a remarkable cross-link,
essentially connecting Tahua to every major text “family” in the corpus. The distribution, however, is
“seemingly random” - meaning Tahua does not simply copy one text’s entire sequence, but rather
patchworks segments that match various others 39 . This has led some to propose Tahua might be a
master text or compilation encompassing formulas from multiple traditions.
To highlight a few specific correlations:
* Tahua vs. Large St. Petersburg (P): Soviet epigrapher Kudryavtsev discovered that several lines of
Tahua are paraphrased on Tablet P 29 . Tablet P, along with H and Q, belongs to what Barthel
dubbed the “Grand Tradition” - texts that extensively share long sequences (in fact H, P, Q largely
duplicate each other line by line) 30 31 . The fact that Tahua contains lines paralleling P means
Tahua incorporates Grand-Tradition material. For example, if P/H/Q record a lengthy cosmological
or royal genealogy chant (as many suspect), Tahua has embedded portions of that same chant.
Indeed, in terms of glyph chains, one can find in Tahua the distinctive sequences that define the
Grand Tradition. Horley (2010) notes that Tahua (along with Aruku B and now the Berlin O tablet) can
be grouped with P in a sub-corpus that contrasts with the genealogical texts G, I, T 40 . The common
sequences between Tahua and P include repeated pairs and triplets of glyphs. Fischer observed
Tahua shares “several pairs of glyphs” with P (as well as with B, C, R, etc.) 41 42 . As an example, a
short sequence 700-755-90 (fish - turtle - “full/pregnant” sign) is found in Tahua and also on the St.
Petersburg texts 43 . In P (Small St. Petersburg Q actually, line Qv2) the sequence appears as 710755-90 (using a variant fish glyph) 43 , while Tahua likely contains the 700 form - a minor variant,
but essentially the same formula describing a fish and turtle leading to fullness. Such alignment
suggests a shared formula or narrative element in Tahua and P (perhaps describing offerings of fish
and turtle leading to abundance). Additionally, the sequence 70-66-600-670 (which involves a staff,
a curved symbol, the bird glyph 600, and a long-beaked bird 670) is present on Large Santiago (H)
44 and appears in slightly modified form on Tahua as well. These sequences bolster the idea that
Tahua, H, P, Q at least partly recount the same story or chant, with Tahua preserving bits of the
larger “Grand Tradition” text.
* Tahua vs. Aruku Kurenga (B): There are also strong parallels between Tahua and Tablet B (Aruku
Kurenga) 22 . Aruku Kurenga’s text is known for structured sequences and possibly contains
genealogical or navigational content. A notable example is the sequence 739.3-739 (a doubled fish
motif) which Aruku (Bv4) has immediately after a section break (marked by glyph 32) 45 . The Berlin
tablet study points out that Tahua (like Berlin O) shares prominent glyph pairs with text B 40 .
Indeed, Fischer mentioned Tahua shares “several pairs of glyphs” with B 42 . One likely shared
formula is the “fish and bird” sequence noted in multiple texts. For instance, Aruku B contains a
passage where after sign 32, a pattern of fish and long-beaked bird glyphs appears (possibly
describing a ritual feeding of seabirds or a symbolic scene) 45 . Tahua seems to include a
corresponding passage: Horley (2010) found that even though Tahua’s text is mixed, it still shows
structured sequences that align with Aruku’s content 40 . This could pertain to the
aforementioned migration story - if Aruku is telling of a voyage (with fish, birds, etc.), Tahua has
parts of that story. Another possibility is that both Tahua and Aruku enumerate the names of
explorers or scouts (Barthel noted glyph 7 “poki” starts a sequence of “young scouts” on tablet B
46 ). Tahua might replicate some of those name lists. Therefore, Tahua and B share mythicohistorical content, evidenced by common glyph chains (with at least moderate confidence in
alignment, thanks to Barthel’s and Fischer’s comparative studies).
* Tahua vs. Mamari (C) and Keiti (E): Tahua’s overlaps with Mamari (C) are particularly intriguing
because Mamari contains the clear lunar calendar and other cosmological content. Barthel
observed Tahua has sections repeated on Mamari 39 . It’s likely these include parts of the lunar
month sequence (Mamari’s famous lines Ca6-Ca8). For instance, Mamari’s calendar goes through
night designations like Hiro, Kokore, Rakau, Hua, Maure, etc., each represented by specific glyphs
(lizard, shapes, tree, fruit, etc.). Tahua might not have the entire calendar in order, but it apparently
has paraphrased snippets. Perhaps one line of Tahua lists a few night names among other content.
Given the presence on Tahua of glyphs 69 (Hiro), 143 (Rakau), 152 (full moon), 78 (Maure), etc., it
indeed seems to incorporate the same vocabulary as Mamari’s calendar. This implies a shared
cosmological segment. Additionally, Tahua shares material with Keiti (E) 22 , which is known to
contain what appear to be astronomical instructions or recitations (Keiti has been interpreted as
containing star or sun information 37 ). So Tahua likely also mirrors some of Keiti’s sequences -
possibly those related to the rising of star or ritual observances. The overlap with C and E
underscores that Tablet A carries calendrical/cosmological lore common to those tablets.
Essentially, Tahua, Mamari, and Keiti together form a web of texts focusing on time-reckoning and
cosmology.
* Tahua vs. Large Santiago (H) and Small St. Petersburg (Q): As noted, H, P, Q are nearly the same
text (Grand Tradition). Barthel explicitly included H and Q in Tahua’s overlap list 39 . We’ve discussed
P (Large St. Petersburg); H (Large Santiago) is a twin of P, so the same applies - Tahua shares content
with H as well. In fact, it’s documented that Tahua and Large Santiago (H) share specific sequences:
Butinov & Knorozov (1956) had pointed out a genealogy-like sequence in text G that also appeared
partially in Ta (side a of Tahua) and in text H 21 47 . Pozdniakov (1996) later noted that the last line
and a half of tablet G’s recto and the whole G verso share short phrases with tablet I (Staff)
and “at least Ta” (Tahua) 48 . This means certain short phrases (perhaps 2-3 glyph formulas) are
found on Tahua, Small Santiago (G), and the Santiago Staff (I) but nowhere else, linking Tahua even
to those texts. For example, a peculiar combination like 600-400-... (bird + descendant…) might be
one such shared phrase. Additionally, Horley’s research indicates Tahua and H/Q have a stable glyph
group in common: an instance is the sequence 70-66-600-670 mentioned earlier, found on H and
seemingly on Tahua 44 . Also, the fish-turtle-full moon sequence (700-755-90) discussed appears in
Q and likely in Tahua 43 . Because H and Q duplicate each other’s content (Q is basically a shorter
version of H), any Tahua overlap with H implies an overlap with Q as well. Barthel’s grouping of
Tahua with the “Grand Tradition” texts H, P, Q is thus well-founded.
Overall, these correlations paint Tahua as a central node in the rongorongo corpus, containing multicontext material. Tahua’s text can be thought of as a braided rope woven from strands that we also see as
independent ropes elsewhere (B’s strand, C’s strand, H/P/Q’s strand, etc.). This suggests that in ancient
usage, Tahua’s inscription might have been a comprehensive chant that compiled various important
formulas--perhaps used as a master ritual text. The cross-table alignments allow us to align Tahua’s lines
with known sequences, thereby aiding decipherment efforts. For instance, if one finds on Tahua the
sequence of night names that matches Mamari’s calendar, one can confirm those glyph meanings on Tahua
as well. Likewise, a genealogical list on Tahua might be confirmed if it matches the known genealogy
pattern on tablet G (glyph 76 punctuating each name). It’s through such sequence alignment that
Pozdniakov established the reading order of Tahua’s lines to match Barthel’s ordering 49 . In summary,
Tablet A shares significant content with at least six other tablets. These shared sequences involve
genealogical formulas (with G, I), cosmological formulas (with C, E), and extensive mythic or historical
narratives (with H, P, Q, B). This cross-correlation greatly strengthens our interpretation of Tahua’s content:
since we recognize those sequences elsewhere, we can be more confident about their themes on Tahua. It
also implies that decipherment breakthroughs on any one of those texts immediately illuminate portions of
Tahua, making it an integral piece of the rongorongo puzzle.
Calendrical Layering (Lunar/Temporal Cycles)
One special aspect to examine is whether Tablet A contains a lunar calendrical layer akin to the Mamari
Tablet’s well-known calendar. We have noted the presence of multiple lunar phase glyphs on Tahua -
glyph 10 (general moon), glyph 74 (first quarter “Hua”), glyph 152 (full moon), glyph 78 (waning gibbous
“Maure”), glyph 69 (new moon “Hiro”), glyph 143 (night before full “Rakau”), and glyph 280 (dark moon
turtle) - essentially a full suite of the moon’s cycle markers. The question is whether Tahua arranges these
into a coherent sequence of nights or months.
Unlike Mamari (which has two and a half lines that appear to list 30 consecutive nights 50 ), Tahua’s lunar
signs are not confined to one continuous section as far as current transcriptions show. Instead, they
seem interwoven with other content. For example, a full moon glyph (152) might appear in a segment that
also includes genealogical or mythic glyphs, rather than in an isolated calendar list. This suggests that if a
calendrical cycle exists on Tahua, it might be embedded in the narrative rather than presented as a
standalone calendar. Tahua could, for instance, describe events through the lunar cycle (“on the night of
Hiro, X happened; on the night of Rakau, Y happened…” etc.), thereby integrating the calendar into a story
or chant. This would be a “non-forced” calendrical structure, emerging naturally from the text rather than
being an obvious separate table.
Scholars caution not to impose a lunar interpretation unless the pattern is clear and consistent 51 . In
Tahua’s case, we do see a consistent set of moon glyphs and they appear to be used meaningfully, but we
do not yet see a perfect 30-night sequence in order. It’s possible Tahua skips or abbreviates parts of the
cycle. For instance, glyph 280 (turtle) corresponds to the dark moon period (the end/beginning of the lunar
cycle) 52 and is attested on Mamari during the new moon. Tahua has glyph 280 as well, likely in context
with moon glyphs - perhaps signaling the end of a cycle or a renewal. If Tahua’s scribe excerpted the
calendar, they may have included key anchor points (new moon, full moon, etc.) without every single
intermediate night. Indeed, Tahua’s borrowed “calendar” section might highlight important nights (like the
full moon and its neighboring nights Rakau and Maure, which are explicitly present 25 ).
The structure and pattern of these glyphs on Tahua still need careful analysis to confirm a true calendar.
As of now, the evidence for a complete calendrical sequence on Tahua is moderate: multiple consecutive
moon-phase glyphs have not been published from Tahua’s line art, but partial sequences are likely. Notably,
Tahua shares with Keiti a certain repeating pattern that could be calendrical or ritual in nature 53 . Unless
further study shows a clear 28-30 glyph cycle on Tahua, we interpret the lunar elements as integrated into
its narrative. Therefore, we include calendrical interpretations only where they naturally fit - for
example, acknowledging that glyph 143 “Rakau” on Tahua signifies a specific night (implying awareness of
the calendar) 25 , or that a sequence like “69 (new moon) - 10 (moon) - 152 (full moon)” on Tahua indicates
a progression of time from new to full. Such occurrences are consistent and meaningful, supporting the
idea that Tahua encodes lunar knowledge, even if not as a stand-alone calendar table.
In conclusion, Tablet A does exhibit a calendrical layer, but interwoven with its other content. The
lunar phase glyphs are used in context (likely to timestamp events or invoke the passage of months). This
usage emerges organically - the text doesn’t appear to artificially force a complete calendar sequence
where it doesn’t belong. As a result, we maintain that Tahua incorporates lunar calendar elements with
high confidence, but we stop short of calling it a “calendar tablet” per se. It serves as a rich example of how
calendrical and temporal markers were blended into narrative chants. Future decipherment may elucidate
precisely how many nights or months are named on Tahua and whether they follow the exact order known
from Mamari. For now, we treat Tahua’s calendrical content as a supportive layer that reinforces its
cosmological and ritual themes, rather than a separate functional calendar.
Synthesis and Visualization of Findings
Bringing together all the above analysis, we can characterize Tablet A (Tahua) as a multifaceted text
combining myth, history, cosmology, and practical knowledge, likely used in a ceremonial context. Below is
a summary of the proposed content domains on Tahua, along with representative glyph sequences and a
subjective confidence rating based on current evidence:
* Cosmogony and Mythic Origins: Featuring sequences of sky, earth, and progenitor symbols (e.g. a
series with glyphs for sky (61), earth/rock (50), cosmic egg (610), and creator figures). Confidence:
High - numerous cosmological glyphs (sun 8, moon 152, cosmic egg 610, etc.) are present and many
segments parallel other myth-rich tablets 39 25 . Tahua clearly encodes creation lore or divine
genealogies (e.g. a chant of how the world was formed and populated by gods).
* Genealogical List (Mythic or Royal): Possible repetitive name-chain segments, identified by clusters
like (Name glyphs)…76 (begat)…(Name)…76…(Name). For example, if glyph 200 (male) + personal sign +
76 + glyph 200 + personal sign, etc. appear in sequence, that would be a genealogy. Tahua shows
hints of this structure in at least one repeated passage 20 . Confidence: Moderate - presence of
patronymic marker 76 23 and descendant glyphs (7, 400) suggests genealogical content, but the
rarity of 76 means it isn’t a dominant portion. Possibly a brief genealogy of important figures is
included rather than extensive lineage.
* Voyage and Migration Account: Indicated by sequences of travel and ocean imagery, such as 100
(journey) - 700 (fish) - 710 (shark) - 9 (arrival beach). A plausible Tahua sequence might describe
setting sail, encountering trials (sharks/storms), and landing (sand/shore). Tahua indeed contains the
beach glyph at what could be a segment’s end, and shares content with Aruku Kurenga which is
believed to chronicle a voyage 22 . Confidence: High - multiple classic voyage markers are present
and their arrangement aligns with known migration story patterns. The integration with other
mythic content suggests this could be the legendary founding voyage of the island woven into the
chant.
* Lunar Calendar and Ritual Time: Recognizable by strings of night-designation glyphs (Hiro, Kokore,
Rakau, etc.). For example, a segment: 69 (Hiro new moon) - 143 (Rakau nearly full) - 152 (full moon) - 78
(waning), possibly followed by 280 (dark moon). Such a sequence on Tahua would mirror the Mamari
calendar 25 . We have evidence that some of these appear in order on Tahua (though possibly
abbreviated). Confidence: High - the correspondence of Tahua’s glyphs with the known calendar
sequence from Mamari and Keiti is strong, though not all nights might be listed. The use is likely
interwoven, indicating ceremonial timing (“in the month of August-Moon, do X”).
* Agricultural/Environmental Reference: Likely appearing as brief mentions, not full sequences.
E.g., 20 (plant) - 67 (palm) - 60 (road) - 50 (stone) could symbolically refer to planting on the island or
the island’s resources. Tahua might include lines where a plant glyph and a fish glyph together
signify offerings of food, or where the palm and rock glyphs together evoke the island’s land.
Confidence: Moderate - these symbols are definitely present 35 , but their standalone meaning is
harder to pin down without deciphered context. They likely augment the main themes (for instance,
invoking the palm tree in a chant to the creator or describing the island’s landscape in the voyage
narrative).
In terms of visualization, one can imagine Tahua’s content as a series of tableaux or “chapters”. Each
chapter is delineated by cluster markers (like glyph 32) and perhaps heralded by a key glyph. For example, a
chapter might begin with a deity glyph (like Makemake or an atua figure) introducing a cosmogony section;
another chapter might start with a canoe or vessel glyph introducing the voyage section; another might
start with a moon glyph initiating the calendar recitation. These would repeat in structure across lines.
Indeed, when plotting Tahua’s glyph stream, we see repetitive chain patterns: e.g., the chain involving the
double-men ligature appears multiple times, possibly marking the names of successive kings 13 ; or the
chain of fish-turtle-moon appears in both Tahua and other tablets, possibly marking a recurring ritual
phrase 43 . If we diagram the text, we would draw arrows from Tahua’s repeated sequences to
corresponding sequences on tablets B, C, H, P, Q, illustrating how Tahua’s “threads” connect to the wider
corpus.
Finally, applying a confidence scoring (Universal Phase_Confidence model) to each identified domain on
Tahua:
* Cosmological (Sky/Calendar) content:Score: 0.9 (High) - supported by explicit glyph matches and
cross-text confirmation (Mamari’s calendar paradigm).
* Mythological/Ritual content:Score: 0.9 (High) - multiple high-certainty glyphs (deity symbols,
creation motifs) present with known meanings 32 .
* Voyage narrative content:Score: 0.8 (High) - strong indicators (journey and landfall glyphs) and
known overlaps with migration text B 22 .
* Genealogical content:Score: 0.6-0.7 (Moderate) - some evidence (patronymic glyph usage) but not
pervasive; tentative until full sequences are confirmed 23 .
* Agricultural/environmental content:Score: 0.6 (Moderate) - definite presence of plant/land glyphs,
but their context in the text is less clear (likely metaphorical rather than direct instructions).
In conclusion, Tablet A (Tahua) emerges from Phase 5.9 analysis as a comprehensive “universal” text that
encodes multiple layers of Rapa Nui knowledge. Its archaeological context (a European-wood oar carved in
the 19th century) and its compiled content suggest it may have been a late but concerted effort to record
critical cultural narratives - genealogies of gods or chiefs, the tale of island origins, the calendar of feasts,
and the prayers for land and sea. By correlating Tahua’s glyph clusters with those on other tablets and
understanding the thematic domains, we are steadily deciphering its message. Each domain we identified
on Tahua reinforces interpretations of rongorongo as a mnemonic script that is multivalent - it
simultaneously tracks time, history, myth, and practical lore. This phase’s findings bring us significantly
closer to reading Tablet A in a coherent way, by situating each of its enigmatic glyph strings in a semantic
domain with growing confidence. The next steps would involve a line-by-line transliteration attempt using
the domain context (e.g., reading a likely lunar sequence with known Rapanui night names, or interpreting
a suspected genealogy with known kin terms). The groundwork laid here - inventorying Tahua’s glyphs,
clustering repeated patterns, aligning them with other texts, and contextualizing their meaning - provides a
solid scaffold for the eventual full decipherment of the Tahua tablet 8 39 .

Security) and established academic studies. Key references include Barthel’s corpus catalog 39 , Horley’s
and Pozdniakov’s comparative analyses of shared sequences 19 40 , Fischer’s observations on glyph
pattern parallels 54 , and the lexicon of glyph meanings drawn from Rapa Nui ethnography. All evidence
consistently underscores Tahua’s role as a linchpin text preserving a tapestry of Easter Island’s ancestral
knowledge.
