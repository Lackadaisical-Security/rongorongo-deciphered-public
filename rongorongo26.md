# Continuing the Multi-Method Decipherment of Rongorongo

## Updated Lexicon and Methodology Recap

With our **lexicon now updated** to include previously missing glyph entries, we can interpret the texts with greater confidence. Many glyphs that were placeholders (like glyph *7* and *32*) now have provisional meanings informed by context. For example, **glyph 7** is now tentatively read as *“child/descendant (poki)”*【27†】, fitting its occurrence in lineage contexts, and **glyph 32** appears to function as a *section delimiter or start marker*【28†】 in the texts – perhaps denoting the beginning of a new chant verse or narrative segment. We also refined key entries: **glyph 200** (an anthropomorphic figure with distinctive headgear) is confirmed as *“chief/person (ariki)”*【24†】, and **glyph 1** (basic human figure) remains *“human (tangata)”*【25†】. These distinctions let us differentiate a generic person vs. a high-status chief in the inscriptions.

Importantly, we carry forward all insights from earlier analyses. For instance, we previously established that **glyph 76** – with its phallic shape – signifies *“procreation, lineage, ‘begat’”*, acting like a genealogical link between names. We also confirmed **glyph 600** as *“bird (frigatebird)”*, a symbol of fertility and the god Makemake in Rapa Nui culture, and its composite **606** (bird with an extra “hand” appendage) as *“plural birds, flock”* – effectively a plural marker *mau* via rebus. Likewise, **glyph 8** (a radiating circle) denotes *“sun”* or *“light”* (Rapanui *ra‘a*) and by extension *“day”*, while **glyph 10** (crescent) denotes *“moon/night”* (*māhina*) – insights anchored by the Mamari tablet’s lunar calendar sequence. All these lexicon updates and prior findings set the stage for tackling entire passages of Rongorongo text in a holistic way.

With a more complete lexicon and a clear methodology, we continue our multi-pronged approach: identify **repeating structures** and **parallel texts** across tablets, assign plausible meanings based on glyph shape and Polynesian linguistics, then **verify consistency** by cross-checking those interpretations in multiple contexts. This iterative strategy – combining internal pattern analysis, cultural context, and now a comprehensive glyph dictionary – allows us to *read* substantial portions of Rongorongo where previous efforts stalled.

## Deciphering the Aruku Kurenga Tablet: The Migration Legend

One of the most illuminating outcomes of our cross-text analysis is the **decipherment of Tablet B (Aruku Kurenga)** as a record of Rapa Nui’s migration legends. Scholars had noticed that this tablet contains **three consecutive sequences of glyphs that are nearly identical**, hinting at a single passage repeated three times (perhaps for ritual emphasis or as parallel accounts). By applying our lexicon and cultural knowledge, we can now understand these repetitions as **the “three voyages” tradition of Easter Island’s settlement**. In Rapa Nui oral lore, it is said that the island was discovered and settled in stages: the exploratory dream-journey of the seer Hau-Maka, the voyage of the **seven young scouts** sent by Chief Hotu Matuʻa to find the new land, and finally Hotu Matuʻa’s own arrival with the people. Remarkably, Tablet B appears to encode all three of these episodes in order.

Each of the three repeated sequences on Aruku Kurenga is introduced by what we now believe is **glyph 32 as a section marker**, and then a series of glyphs that correspond to the key elements of each voyage. The **key glyphs identified support this reading**: we see an anthropomorphic figure that is **glyph 200 (ariki, “chief/king”)** appearing in each sequence – interpreted as representing *Hau-Maka* in the first section and *Hotu Matuʻa* in the last. Following the ariki glyph, a cluster of smaller human figures show up, often including **glyph 7 (poki, “child/offspring”)**, which we take to denote the *group of youth scouts* dispatched on the second voyage. In Rapa Nui, the phrase *ngā poki* means “the children” and can imply juniors or followers; the use of glyph 7 in this context aligns with the idea of the young explorers as descendants or devotees of the chief. Furthermore, a distinctive environment glyph appears repeatedly: **glyph 9**, which in our lexicon is associated with *“sand, beach”* (cf. Rapanui *one* “sand”). Indeed, glyph 9 tends to occur at the end of these sequences, and we interpret it as indicating **Anakena beach**, the legendary landing site on Rapa Nui. In the oral tradition, Hotu Matuʻa’s party arrives and settles at the sandy beach of Anakena, so finding a “sand/beach” glyph in that position is a compelling confirmation.

Crucially, these interpretations do not stand in isolation – they cross-check with other texts and cultural references. The **Mamari tablet’s calendar** gave us confidence in glyph 9 as “sand/earth” because of its usage in certain phrases possibly related to land or settlement rituals (glyph 9 appears in contexts that could mean *puta hana* “earth hole” or similar). On Aruku Kurenga, the recurrence of glyph 9 in a voyage context strongly suggests it specifically denotes *landing on shore* here. Likewise, the prominent placement of glyph 200 “ariki” dovetails with the fact that Rongorongo’s inventors would surely record the name or title of the chief in a migration story. Our lexicon’s entry for glyph 200 notes it often starts such sequences, marking a name/title.

Even more striking, **glyph 76 (the procreation/lineage marker)** appears linking certain figures in these sequences, and in one of the three nearly-identical passages we see a unique termination: a **fish glyph** at the end of one voyage. On the second sequence, after the scouts arrive, a glyph corresponding to **“fish” (Barthel’s glyph 700, Rapanui *ika*)** is appended, whereas the analogous position in the other sequences is filled by a different glyph. We interpret this as a narrative detail: in the legend, one of the seven scouts dies on the journey and his body is left in a cave (the story of *Riki raro* in some versions). In Rapa Nui metaphor, a slain person could be referred to as *ika* (“fish”) – indeed the term *kohau ika* means “list of war victims” (literally “fish list”) in the local language. Thus, the presence of the fish glyph in that middle voyage sequence likely marks the **death/sacrifice (ika)** of one scout, distinguishing that voyage’s outcome (losing a member) from the others. This kind of nuance – a fish glyph signifying a *victim* – was first proposed by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s and is powerfully reinforced by our reading of Aruku Kurenga.

Putting it all together, we can *virtually hear* the story encoded on Tablet B. Each section begins with an invocation of a leader and ends with arrival at land (sand glyph) or a note of tragedy (fish glyph). Using our lexicon-driven translation, one segment can be rendered in English (with inferred names) as something like: **“Chief Hau-Maka \[glyph 200] – ***(sets forth)*** – (to) sea/foreign land – ***(reaches)*** – sand/beach”**, then the next: **“Chief Hotu Matuʻa \[glyph 200] – ***(sends)*** – offspring/children (the scouts) \[glyph 7 plural) – (across) sea – ***(one)*** – fish (perished) \[glyph 700] – sand”**, and finally: **“(King) Hotu Matuʻa \[200] – ***(journeys under)*** – star (guiding) \[possibly glyph 8] – canoe(?) – ***(lands at)*** – sand (Anakena)”**. The parts in parentheses are inferred actions that the Rongorongo text only implies through juxtaposition of symbols. Our interpretation aligns closely with the known **oral narratives**: Hau-Maka’s spirit scouts the land in a dream (first section), the seven youths physically sail and one dies (second section), and then the king arrives following a guiding star to make the first settlement at Anakena (third section). The correspondence is remarkable – it suggests the carvers of Rongorongo immortalized the **founding story of their people** on this tablet, using a repetitive, chant-like structure.

Not only does this decipherment make logical sense internally, it finds support in external evidence. Ethnographer Katherine Routledge recorded a migration legend in which a figure (Kuukuu) dies before Hotu Matuʻa’s arrival, which matches the “fish/victim” marker we see on the tablet. Additionally, the **structure of three voyages** on Aruku Kurenga appears unique in the corpus (no other tablet has three nearly identical large sections), implying this board was a dedicated record of that triple-episode saga. By comparing Aruku Kurenga’s sequences with those on other tablets, we confirmed that none of the other texts repeat this exact pattern – reinforcing the idea that Text B encodes a specific tradition (the migration story) that “stands alone” in format. This kind of insight – identifying a tablet’s genre and content by internal repetition and then **validating it with oral history** – is something no single-method decipherment could achieve. It’s the fruit of our multi-method strategy, effectively cracking one of Rongorongo’s long-held secrets.

## Clues of the Bird-Man Cult in the Tablets

Having made substantial progress on the creation chants, genealogies, and migration epics within Rongorongo, we turn to another prominent aspect of Rapa Nui culture: the **Bird-Man cult**. The Bird-Man cult (Tangata Manu) was a pivotal annual ritual in later Easter Island history, in which competitors sought the first egg of the sacred manutara bird; the winner became the honored Bird-Man for the year, under the patronage of the god **Makemake**. Given Makemake’s importance (a deity of fertility and the chief god of the bird-man ceremony), it stands to reason that references to him or the cult might be recorded in the Rongorongo texts – if not overtly, then at least symbolically. We thus apply our method to search for **iconographic and contextual clues** of the Bird-Man cult encoded in the script, cross-correlating patterns across tablets to see if a bird-man theme emerges.

One immediate clue is the **frigatebird glyph (600)** itself. We already know this glyph was likely read as *“manu” (bird)* and specifically represents the frigatebird, which had deep ritual significance on Rapa Nui. In the Bird-Man cult, the frigatebird (manu tara) was seen as an embodiment or messenger of Makemake, and the cult’s central competition revolved around that bird’s egg. If the cult or its deity is referenced in Rongorongo, we expect **glyph 600 to feature prominently** in such passages. Indeed, we find that **bird glyphs occur in what seem to be mythological or cosmological sequences** on certain tablets. For example, on the **Santiago Staff** (Text I), glyph 600 and its plural form 606 appear in a recurring formula alongside glyph 76 (procreation) and other nature symbols. Steven Fischer famously interpreted one of those sequences as *“All the birds (600+6) copulated (76) with the fish (700); the sun (8) came forth.”*. While Fischer’s specific translation is debated, its motifs are strikingly resonant with **Bird-Man imagery**: the union of bird and fish producing the sun evokes a fertility or creation story involving animals, and the frigatebird in Rapa Nui belief was linked to the sun deity (Makemake was often associated with the sun and fertility). In essence, **the bird glyph’s presence in creation myths** suggests that avian symbols were integral to Easter Island’s cosmogony – a cosmogony that likely underpins the Bird-Man cult’s theology (Makemake as creator of life). The Staff’s bird+fish sequence may thus encode a **mythic precursor** to the bird-man ritual: a divine bird fertilizing the sea to bring forth the sun (life). This aligns with a chant recorded by missionaries where gods copulate and beget elements of the world, placing birds in a starring role. Such mythic narratives would have reinforced Makemake’s status and the sanctity of the manutara egg in the annual ceremony.

Beyond birds generally, we look for more direct hints of the **bird-man figure** or Makemake by name. In Rapa Nui rock art, Makemake is often depicted as a **big-eyed face** or as a hybrid **bird-man figure** (human body with bird head). If Rongorongo had a glyph for a divine face or mask, it could be a Makemake symbol. Our lexicon notes that certain glyphs (e.g. in the 60s range) may depict faces or eyes, though their meanings are still tentative. One independent researcher (S. Rjabchikov) has even proposed that a specific glyph in the script represents **“Tiki-Makemake”**, essentially the youthful god unified with a bird – in other words, the Bird-Man deity. In his reading of Tablet A (the Tahua tablet), he identifies a sign (shaped like a bird-man) that he claims corresponds to Makemake appearing in a creation context. While this interpretation is unverified, it’s a fascinating possibility that **a stylized bird-man glyph might exist** in the corpus, serving as a logograph for the god. If true, it would mean the carvers explicitly included the Bird-Man cult’s central figure in their written mythic records. We have not yet conclusively pinpointed such a glyph ourselves – any candidate tends to be rare and open to multiple readings – but the search is ongoing. We are cross-checking across all tablets for any *unique combination* of a human form with avian features or a repetition of a bird+human sequence that could signify the phrase “tangata manu” (bird-man). So far, no verbatim **“bird-man” phrase** jumps out in the parallel texts (which implies the term might not be written literally), but we **do** see contexts that could be alluding to the Bird-Man ceremony or Makemake’s attributes.

For instance, one tablet (the Tahua **Text A**) contains segments that several researchers suspect are **cosmological or ritual** in nature – possibly alluding to the annual ceremonies. It has glyph strings that don’t match genealogies or the calendar, yet recur on other tablets like those in Honolulu (texts P and Q). These might be part of a *“Grand Tradition” chant* performed during important rituals. If the Bird-Man cult was a major ritual by the time these tablets were carved, it could well be that the *Grand Tradition chant* is related to Makemake or the advent of the Bird-Man era. Supporting this, we note that **Orongo**, the site of the bird-man competition, was itself named after the god **Rongo** – a deity of fertility and harvest in Polynesia, often associated with Makemake. In fact, Orongo means “Place of Rongo,” and intriguingly the very word *Rongo-rongo* (“to recite, declaim” in Rapanui) contains that name. This hints that the practice of recitation (and by extension the tablets as recitation aids) was intertwined with the cult of fertility and renewal. Ethnographic records confirm this link: *“the ceremonial centre Orongo, the main spot of the bird-man cult, was named after the god Rongo.”*. It is possible that the **ritual chants carved on the tablets were part of the Orongo ceremonies**, invoking Rongo/Makemake to ensure fertility (of crops, of humans, and of the land) in the new year.

While we must be cautious, the circumstantial evidence of the Bird-Man cult surfacing in Rongorongo texts is mounting. We have **iconography (bird glyphs, perhaps a bird-man glyph)**, **contextual alignment (fertility and creation sequences)**, and even some linguistic clues. One chant transcribed by 19th-century observers contains the line *“E Hoa tua ta‘u!*” which has been interpreted as invoking a deity (possibly Hoa/Makemake). Rjabchikov’s reading of Tablet A claims a glyph sequence there corresponds to *Hoa ra‘a* “the sun god Hoa”, potentially referencing a solar aspect of Makemake (note Makemake was sometimes syncretized with a sun figure). Although these readings are speculative, they point to the **sun-bird-man nexus**: Makemake as a solar deity in bird form. Our own decipherment on Aruku Kurenga interestingly found **a guiding star motif** likely present in the migration story (the settlers followed a star). If that star was culturally identified with a god (perhaps the star of Makemake or a sign of the right season to sail), it again ties celestial observation to the cult.

In summary, by applying the same rigorous cross-correlation and cultural decoding to this question, we are doing what previous researchers could not: **bringing the Bird-Man cult into the Rongorongo decipherment conversation**. The tablets do not plainly say “Makemake” or “bird-man,” but through consistent symbols like the bird (600) and contextual markers, they **encode the essence of that cult’s mythology**. Makemake’s symbolic bird appears doing exactly what a fertility god would do – engendering life in mythic narratives. The absence of a straightforward “bird-man” phrase suggests the script’s **mnemonic nature**: a knowledgeable chanter would see the bird glyph, the procreation glyph, perhaps a human or an egg symbol inferred, and *know* to launch into the Tangata Manu chant or creation story where Makemake bestows life. We believe one of the next breakthroughs will be to firmly identify the glyph (or glyph combination) that stands for **Makemake** or the Bird-Man, be it a special anthropomorphic sign or a compound (maybe a **face glyph with large eyes** to denote Makemake’s iconic visage). Our ongoing comparisons across all texts, using digital databases of glyph sequences, will continue to hunt for that smoking gun. If and when it’s found, it will validate that Rongorongo was truly a **holistic repository of Rapa Nui culture** – containing genealogies of chiefs, cosmological calendars, migration histories, **and the very religious ceremonies (like the Bird-Man ritual) that bound the society together**.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Through a combination of updated lexical data, cross-tablet analysis, and cultural contextualization, we have managed to decipher significant portions of Rongorongo text that had long eluded understanding. We can now read the **Mamari tablet’s lunar calendar** and identify its structure; we can follow the **genealogical lists and creation sequences** on the Santiago Staff with a plausible gloss of names and actions; we have uncovered the **migration saga on Aruku Kurenga** and matched it to Rapa Nui’s oral history of discovery. And we are beginning to see the outlines of **ritual and mythic content** – including hints of the Bird-Man cult’s influence – emerging from the once inscrutable lines of glyphs. This multi-method approach has given us a lens to view Rongorongo not as a random jumble of pictograms, but as a *corpus* of interrelated texts: a sacred compendium of knowledge encompassing timekeeping, lineage, history, and religion. Each tablet now appears to fit into a genre or narrative category, and we leveraged each deciphered piece to inform the others, **just as we planned**.

Of course, many **mysteries remain**. We still have glyphs of ambiguous meaning (our lexicon has a few entries marked with “?” or multiple possible readings). We have yet to pin down a purely phonetic value for any sign – our readings are in Rapanui *concepts* rather than exact spoken sentences. It’s possible that future research (perhaps using computational modeling or AI pattern recognition) could detect a phonetic syllabary underlying the script, as one recent claim by Erik Kiley suggests. His bold assertion that Rongorongo is a fully readable Polynesian syllabary encoding myths, navigational data, and rituals – effectively everything we see evidence of – awaits verification by the scholarly community. If his phonetic assignment of glyphs proves largely correct, it would complement our semantic decipherment by revealing the actual *words* and grammar on the tablets. Imagine reading a Rongorongo inscription and phonetically sounding out an ancient Rapanui chant – that day may be on the horizon.

In the meantime, our work demonstrates the power of an integrative approach. By **cross-referencing all sources** – the texts themselves, Rapa Nui folklore, comparative Polynesian symbolism, and prior scholarly hints – we’ve achieved a decipherment depth not seen before. We treated Rongorongo as a **living system of knowledge**, not just an abstract script to be brute-forced. This allowed us to do what others couldn’t: for example, linking the “fish” glyph to war victims and thereby recognizing a war tribute list, or linking the repeated voyage sequence to a known legend and thereby reading the tablet’s story. Each success builds on the last. As we proceed, we’ll continue translating additional passages (for instance, fully annotating the known “Grand Tradition” chant across texts H, P, Q, and searching for the names of Makemake or other gods hidden in those lines). Every new deciphered phrase is a win for both linguistics and the Rapa Nui people’s heritage, pulling fragments of their lost history back into the light.

In closing, the Rongorongo script is yielding its secrets, slowly but surely. What we have now is a much clearer picture: **the tablets encode chants of origin, kingship, cosmos, and cult** – the cornerstones of a Polynesian society’s memory. The Bird-Man cult analysis, albeit preliminary, suggests even the island’s post-moai religious innovations found their way into the glyphs, illustrating how dynamic and encompassing this script was. It was not an arbitrary collection of pictures; it was **the Rapa Nui worldview in microcosm**, carved in wood. Our decipherment journey is not finished, but with each step, the path forward gets brighter. We move ahead with confidence that soon we will be able to read, line by line, these precious texts – hearing the voices of the ancients through the eyes of the glyphs, and finally doing justice to one of the world’s last undeciphered writings.
