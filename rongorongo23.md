# Deciphering the Keiti Tablet (Text E): Multi-Method Analysis and Cross-Tablet Correlations

## Introduction: Tablet E (Keiti) Background and Structure

Tablet **E**, known as *Keiti*, is one of the larger Rongorongo inscriptions (approximately 880 glyphs across 17 lines). It was collected by Catholic missionaries in the 1870s and later lost in World War I, surviving only via rubbings and photographs. Bishop Jaussen’s informant **Metoro** attempted to “read” Keiti in the 1860s, but his *chant-like recitation* was inconsistent and likely not a true decoding. In fact, Metoro read one side upside-down and backwards, mixing line endings. This demonstrated early on that **reading order and orientation were non-intuitive**, requiring careful analysis of the script’s structure. Thomas Barthel later determined the text should be read in boustrophedon order (alternating direction per line), and a discovery by Konstantin Pozdniakov confirmed this: a continuous phrase splits between the last line of Keiti’s recto and the first line of its verso, matching sequences on other tablets and **proving Barthel’s line order was correct**. Intriguingly, line 3 on the recto side terminates abruptly with its tail squeezed between lines – the *same scribal quirk* seen on Aruku Kurenga (Text B). Such formatting hints that Keiti’s scribe followed similar practices to those who inscribed Text B, possibly indicating a shared time period or training.

Physically, Keiti was a beautifully carved fluted tablet. Its glyphs, like those of other tablets, are richly pictorial. Scholars note that **Keiti’s sign shapes closely resemble Rapa Nui petroglyph art** – stylized humans, animals, celestial symbols, etc. – and **do not match any Old World script**. This strongly supports Rongorongo as an independent invention drawing on indigenous iconography rather than an imported writing system. Any cross-cultural resemblance (e.g. a crescent for “moon”) appears to be coincidental or due to universal imagery. In short, Keiti provides us with a well-preserved example of Rongorongo’s visual complexity and structural clues, making it an ideal candidate for a deep, multi-method decipherment attempt.

## Repeating Patterns and Cross-Tablet Parallels

A key step in deciphering Keiti is identifying **internal patterns and parallels with other texts**. Earlier statistical studies found that most Rongorongo tablets are composed of **shared “stock phrases” and parallel sequences**. Keiti is no exception: Pozdniakov’s analysis uncovered that Keiti contains a sequence of glyphs found on *several other tablets*. In fact, by comparing texts side-by-side, Pozdniakov catalogued around **100 recurring phrase sequences** across the corpus, indicating that scribes often copied or remixed standardized chants, lists, or narratives. Some tablets are largely *copies* of others, and even Keiti shows content overlap with the known “Grand Tradition” texts (a set of mythic/genealogical recitations).

Notably, one **structural pattern** on Keiti has drawn particular attention: researchers observed a *cycle of glyph clusters* repeating about **ten times** in the inscription. Upon closer analysis, it appears Keiti’s recto is organized into roughly ten similar segments of glyphs, each of nearly equal length and internal structure. This regular repetition suggests an ordered list or litany rather than free prose. Such a pattern could imply a **calendrical or enumerative text**. For example, the Mamari tablet’s lunar calendar has \~30 repeating units (one per night) – by analogy, Keiti’s ten-part cycle might represent *ten months or ritual periods*, each subdivided into smaller units. Indeed, one hypothesis is that **Keiti encodes astronomical or calendrical information**: Rafal Wieczorek (2011) argued that Keiti’s recto contains observations or instructions for the **Rapa Nui lunar calendar**, similar in function to Mamari’s known month sequence. He identified a recurring “sequence α” on Keiti that he believes corresponds to the sequence of nights in a lunar month, repeated in sections. If true, Keiti could be recording multiple months (for instance, a **ritual year** of 10 months, which might hint at an incomplete or special cycle). This bold theory positions Keiti as potentially the *second* tablet (after Mamari) to carry calendrical content, an exciting prospect for cracking more glyph meanings.

At the same time, cross-tablet comparison hints that Keiti’s text may *not* be purely a calendar. The shared phrases between Keiti and other tablets often occur in **mythological or genealogical contexts**. For instance, Boris Kudrjavtsev and Thomas Barthel noted that a specific alternating pattern – an anthropomorphic figure followed by glyph 76, then another figure – appears on multiple tablets and likely signifies a genealogical formula (“Person A *begat* Person B”). On Aruku Kurenga (Text B), this pattern was repeated thrice in a list of ancestors, and glyph *200* was interpreted as **ariki** (chief/king) while glyph *76* is the “procreation” or lineage link. If similar **chief–offspring chains** occur on Keiti, it would mean parts of its text are a king list or mythic genealogy. In fact, *parallel passages have enabled such identifications*: when one tablet shows X–76–Y and another tablet’s parallel line shows a variant X–76–Z, it suggests Y and Z were interchangeable names in a list (confirming a lineage pattern). Researchers have found that **Keiti shares sequences with Text H, P, and Q**, which are thought to be cosmogonic genealogies (“Grand Tradition” creation chants). This implies that beyond any calendar data, Keiti likely embeds a **mythic narrative or pedigree of gods/ancestors** formatted in repetitive verses. In short, the tablet seems to carry *structured content* with potentially dual nature: one part highly periodic (possibly calendrical), and another part formulaic narrative (genealogy or myth). Recognizing these patterns across tablets is invaluable – as each repeated phrase we decipher on one can instantly illuminate the others.

## Iconographic and Lexical Clues in Keiti’s Glyphs

Parallel analysis gives us the *structure* of Keiti’s text; **iconography and lexicon** give us clues to its *content*. Rongorongo glyphs are pictographic, so we ask: what do Keiti’s prominent signs depict, and what could they mean in Rapa Nui culture? By consulting our updated glyph lexicon and comparing with Polynesian vocabulary, we can hypothesize several key symbols on Keiti:

* **Crescent Moon (glyph 10)** – This sign, a crescent shape, appears frequently if Keiti indeed has lunar references. In the Mamari calendar, glyph 10 unmistakably means “moon/night”. Our lexicon likewise glosses it as *māhina* (moon). If Keiti’s repeated segments are calendar-like, we expect glyph 10 to mark the nights or months. Identifying crescents at regular intervals on Keiti lends weight to the lunar calendar theory.

* **Full Moon (glyph 152)** – A distinctive circular glyph with interior markings that was recognized as the **full moon** in Mamari’s sequence. In Mamari it appears exactly at the midpoint (night 15). Should Keiti contain an analogous cycle, glyph 152 would signify the completion of a cycle (full moon or “whole” period). Interestingly, our lexicon notes glyph 152 carries the meaning “complete/entire” (*katoa* in Rapanui). If Keiti lists months, a *full moon glyph* might mark the end of each month or a key ritual night, echoing Mamari’s usage. The presence of this sign on Keiti (and possibly at predictable intervals) strongly supports an **astronomical content** interpretation.

* **Anthropomorphic Figure (glyphs 1, 200, etc.)** – Human-like figures abound in Rongorongo. Glyph 1 is a generic person (*tangata*), while glyph 200 appears to depict a figure with distinct adornment and is often read as *ariki* (chief or important person). On Keiti, sequences of person glyphs can indicate lists of people – e.g. a genealogy of chiefs or mythic figures. If we see a **repeated chain of human figures linked by glyph 76 (phallic “beget” symbol)**, it’s a big clue that “X son of Y, Y son of Z…” is being recorded. In fact, our lexicon assigns glyph 76 the meaning *“copulate/procreate”* (Polynesian *‘ai* or *fanau*) with very high confidence【9†】. Thus, a series like **(glyph 200)–76–(glyph 200)** on Keiti would read roughly as “chief A begat chief B”. Such patterns, if identified, align with the cosmogonic genealogy content hypothesized for Keiti’s overlapping sequences. It is noteworthy that in one modern decipherment attempt, the word **“ariki” (chief)** explicitly appears in a translated line of Keiti, reinforcing that some human figures likely denote kings or patriarchs.

* **Bird Glyph (glyph 600 and variant 606)** – Keiti’s text, if mythological, might reference the sacred **frigatebird** (*manu tara*), a powerful symbol on Easter Island. Glyph 600 is a bird figure (Barthel’s #600), which our lexicon marks as “bird (likely frigatebird)”. When drawn with an attached “hand” (glyph 6) to form 606, it pluralizes to “birds” or a collective flock. On the Santiago Staff (Text I), a sequence “606.76 700” was interpreted as “all the birds copulated with the fish” producing the sun – clearly a mythic metaphor. If Keiti contains bird glyphs, they could symbolize a *clan totem or a deity*. In Rapa Nui lore, the bird is associated with the god **Makemake** (creator deity) and the Birdman cult. Thus, a bird sign in a cosmogonic text might denote a god or an ancestral tribe named for a bird. Indeed, Butinov and Knorozov suggested that on some tablets a bird glyph could stand for a lineage or clan name. We will watch for glyph 600/606 on Keiti as an indicator of divine or clan entities in the story.

* **Fish Glyph (glyph 700)** – Fish imagery is also prominent in Rongorongo. Glyph 700 is identified as “fish” (*ika*) in our lexicon【20†】. However, Polynesian metaphor gives it a secondary meaning: *îka* “fish” is a term for a **victim or vanquished enemy** (e.g. a “fish” caught in war). On Keiti, fish glyphs might appear in sequences that list offerings, sacrifices, or defeated foes in a mythic conflict. If Keiti indeed has a segment like the Staff’s birds+fish = sun formula, the fish could represent an object of creation or a sacrificial element. For example, if a line in Keiti combined a person glyph, glyph 76, and glyph 700, one could speculate it means “Person procreates (or produces) fish,” perhaps an allegorical way to say “so-and-so’s offspring became *ika* (victims)”. While speculative, the dual meaning of *ika* is well-attested in Rapa Nui, and any context of conquest or offering in the text might be marked by the fish symbol. Keiti’s hypothesized “primordial tale” could involve such metaphors (e.g. clans being defeated or offerings to gods), so glyph 700 is another sign to analyze in context.

* **Celestial and Natural Symbols** – In addition to moon and sun, Keiti might feature other nature glyphs that our lexicon and pictographic analysis can interpret. For instance, **glyph 8 (radiant circle)** is likely “Sun” or a general symbol of light/day (*ra‘ā* in Rapanui). If Keiti’s text mentions the sun (perhaps in a creation context or as “the primordial Ra”), glyph 8 would convey that. Interestingly, an independent researcher’s reading of Keiti includes the phrase “the primordial Ra was traveling” – which suggests she identified glyph 8 (or a variant) as *Ra* (sun) in the text. Likewise, **glyph 40 (wavy lines)** looks like water and likely means “sea” or “water” (*vai, moana*). If Keiti’s myth involves voyages or the primeval ocean (common in Polynesian cosmogonies), glyph 40 could appear. **Glyph 20 (branching form)** resembles a tree or plant (*rākau*), possibly signifying growth, genealogy (family tree), or land. And **glyph 30 (enclosure)** may mean “house” or sacred enclosure – perhaps indicating places or settlements in a migration narrative. Each of these identifications comes from both the shape (iconographic guess) and, where possible, 19th-century hints (Metoro, for example, reportedly uttered “ra’ā” for a sun-like glyph and “mahu” (bird) for a bird glyph). While Metoro’s glosses are unreliable overall, the obvious pictographs (sun, bird, fish, turtle, etc.) tend to align with their expected Rapanui names, giving us a small lexicon of probable glyph meanings.

By leveraging these clues, we can create a **working translation** of Keiti’s glyph strings into thematic elements. For example, a hypothetical segment from Keiti might parse as: *Moon – moon – (feathered) human – phallus – human – fish – sun*. In narrative terms, this could be read as “On a certain night, a chief (ariki) begat a child who was sacrificed to become the sun,” which is reminiscent of Polynesian creation myths. Indeed, some scholars have posited exactly this kind of story for the tablets (the sun or stars being born from unions of gods, etc.). Such interpretations must be tested against the text – do the sequences repeat appropriately, do the glyph meanings hold consistent? – but the **iconographic approach combined with lexicon data** gives us a plausible storyline for Keiti even before we assign full phonetic values.

## Interpretative Hypotheses: Calendar, Myth, or Both?

Bringing together the structural and iconographic evidence, what **content** does Tablet Keiti likely encode? Two leading hypotheses have emerged, and they need not be mutually exclusive:

**1. Keiti as an Astronomical/Calendrical Text:**  As noted, one camp sees Keiti as essentially a companion to the Mamari lunar calendar. Wieczorek’s analysis argues that the recto of Keiti contains **astronomical instructions or observations** related to the lunar cycle. Specifically, he identifies a repeating sequence (labelled *“alpha 1–10”*) that he interprets as the nights of the moon, perhaps grouped in sets (the outline of his paper even references a *28-night month* structure on Keiti). If Keiti does indeed enumerate nights or months, it would confirm that Rapanui experts recorded calendrical knowledge on multiple tablets. This could mean Keiti’s purpose was practical (guiding ritual timing, agriculture, navigation by stars, etc.), or didactic (teaching the lunar cycle). Supporting this, the **presence of glyphs 10 (moon) and 152 (full moon)** in a periodic pattern on Keiti would mirror Mamari’s confirmed calendar. Additionally, Paul Horley and Konstantin Pozdniakov have both noted *“calendar-like structures”* in Keiti and others – sequences that align with the idea of months or seasons being listed. If Keiti’s text is decoded as a calendar, it would be a breakthrough: we could then assign phonetic or at least logographic values to the glyphs representing Rapa Nui month names or night names. It’s tantalizing to think that hidden in Keiti’s rows might be the **Polynesian month names** or references to solstices, star phases, etc. (For instance, a glyph for “Turtle” might correspond to the star Rigel – *hetu‘u* honu in Rapanui – which times certain months; this is speculative but illustrates the possibilities.)

**2. Keiti as a Mythic Genealogy or “Primordial Tale”:** Another interpretation frames Keiti as largely narrative – essentially a **cosmogonic chant or king list** carved in wood. Independent researcher Suzanne Redalia-Sullivan recently attempted a phonetic decipherment of Keiti, titling it *“A Rapa Nui Tale of Primordial Times.”* In her reading (which uses an acrophonic approach to assign sounds to glyphs), the text of Keiti turns into Rapanui sentences describing creation-era events and genealogies. For example, she translates one passage as: *“The primordial Rā was traveling… a procreator laid a row of \[offspring]… Lo! An unborn child swims!”*. Another line from her decipherment mentions *“personal possessions are not sacred… Their lack is like… \[something]”*, and yet another references **ariki** (chiefs) and a *palisade* in what sounds like the founding of a habitation. While her specific phonetic assignments are unproven, it’s striking that the **gist of her translation aligns with known Polynesian myth motifs** – a wandering primordial deity, a miraculous birth from the water, the establishment of sacred vs. profane, and chiefly genealogical elements. She even notes that a phrase in Keiti *“also appears in other Polynesian genealogies.”*, suggesting that the text shares content with oral traditions. This independent result dovetails with mainstream clues: the recurring *X–76–Y* sequences indicating procreation, the bird and fish symbols suggesting mythic players, and the overlaps with other tablets’ genealogical lists. In essence, Keiti could be recording a **Rapa Nui creation chant or ancestral origin story**. Such a chant might enumerate how the world’s elements and tribes were born, how the first chiefs came to be, and perhaps even how the island was settled. It’s noteworthy that Polynesian cosmogonies (like the *Atua Matariri* chant of Rapa Nui or the Maori creation narratives) often mix **astronomy with genealogy** – they recount nights, stars, and months alongside the deeds of gods and ancestors. This raises the exciting possibility that *both* views of Keiti are right: the tablet could encode a mythological narrative **structured around the passage of nights or months**. In other words, Keiti might be a **lunisolar myth** – for example, a chant where each verse corresponds to a night of the lunar month, telling what happened in mythology on that night. Verse 1 could start at new moon with the first god, and verse 15 might mark the full moon with a major event (hence a full moon glyph at that point), and so on. This would elegantly fuse the calendar hypothesis with the primordial tale hypothesis.

**Which interpretation holds?** As of now, Keiti’s exact meaning remains unconfirmed – “the content, as well as the meaning, of all but one of these 25 rongorongo texts is still unknown,” as Wieczorek reminds us. However, our multi-method analysis strongly suggests that **Keiti contains both structured temporal sequences *and* narrative (possibly genealogical) content**. The recurring patterns and moon glyphs nudge us toward an astronomical framework, while the shared phrases and iconic figures nudge us toward a cosmogonic genealogy. The truth could be that we are dealing with a *ritual text* that served a dual purpose: an aide-mémoire for the timing of ceremonies and a recitation of sacred history. In Polynesian cultures, chants often had layered functions – a single composition could encode calendrical knowledge, mythic lineage, and moral lessons all at once. Keiti may well be such a composition.

## Synthesis of Methods and Next Steps

The investigation of Tablet Keiti shows the power of a **holistic decipherment approach**. By combining structural analysis, cross-tablet comparison, iconographic interpretation, and even tentative phonetic readings, we can sketch a plausible picture of what this text holds. On the one hand, we leveraged known cultural context (the lunar calendar, Rapa Nui mythology) to make sense of repetitive glyph patterns. On the other, we used internal evidence – like parallel sequences and glyph substitution across texts – to infer syntax and roles of glyphs (e.g. 76 as a relational verb, 200 as a title). We also carefully consulted comparative lexicons (from Rapa Nui and other Polynesian languages, and even broader sign lists) and found that Rongorongo’s signs align far more with **local Polynesian meanings** than anything external. For instance, the shapes for sun, moon, fish, bird all correspond to Rapa Nui words/concepts – reinforcing that decipherment must be grounded in Rapa Nui language and lore. Cross-script experiments (checking Sumerian or Indus sign charts, etc.) turned up no credible link, which is consistent with the script’s unique development. This means our best bet is to continue cross-referencing **within the Rongorongo corpus and with Rapa Nui oral traditions**.

So, what have we learned about Keiti? It likely enumerates a sequence of events or entities, broken into repetitive sections possibly keyed to time cycles. It names or implies key figures (chiefs, deities like a bird or the sun) and might describe foundational episodes (births, travels, perhaps a primordial journey or the “Redhead” figure as one translation suggests). We can be fairly confident about certain glyph meanings (moon, sun, chief, bird, fish, etc.) and the general syntactic role of others (the “connector” glyph 76). With these, portions of Keiti’s text begin to **read in outline**: e.g., “Night X – Chief So-and-so copulated with \_\_\_; \_\_\_ was born; … Night Y – \_\_\_” and so forth, or in mythic terms “In month X, god A joined with god B, producing C…”. While a full literal translation remains elusive, the convergence of evidence is steadily shrinking the mystery.

Importantly, the methods refined on Keiti will guide the analysis of other tablets. Many Rongorongo texts remain to be explored, and some may contain even more surprising stories. For example, one text (Barthel’s **Text X**, also called *Tangata manu*) is rumored to involve a **human-animal hybrid figure** – possibly tying into the famed Birdman cult or other metamorphic myths. Armed with the knowledge gleaned from Mamari, Aruku, and Keiti, we are poised to tackle such texts next. Each deciphered element builds on the last: Keiti’s apparent mix of calendar and cosmogony could be the bridge that helps us interpret the symbolic language of Text X’s hybrid myth. By maintaining this comprehensive approach – meticulous pattern analysis, cultural contextualization, lexicon cross-checking, and cautious openness to new hypotheses – we move step by step closer to unlocking Rongorongo’s secrets. The case of the Keiti tablet exemplifies how **multiple lines of evidence can converge on meaning**: even without a “Rosetta Stone,” the script starts to speak, revealing the echoes of Rapa Nui’s ancestral knowledge carved in wood centuries ago.
