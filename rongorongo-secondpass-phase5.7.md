## # Santiago Staff (Tablet I) - Phase 5.7 Multi‑Domain

### Analysis

Tablet Context and Structure
The Santiago Staff (Barthel text I) is a wooden chieftain’s staff about 126 cm long and 6 cm in diameter, fully
incised with rongorongo glyphs 1 . It was obtained in 1870 by the Chilean corvette O’Higgins (given by
Frenchman Dutrou-Bornier, who claimed it was a royal staff) and by 1876 entered the Museo Nacional in
Santiago 2 . This artifact is the only surviving inscribed staff (kouhau), suggesting that such staffs were
once as common as the wooden tablets 3 . The wood type is undetermined, but the carving is
exceptionally fine; Barthel remarked its creator “must have been a master of his discipline” 1 . The staff’s
glyphs are arranged in 13 lines (plus a partial 14th), running along the cylindrical surface 4 . Due to the
tapering shape, one line (Barthel’s line 12) is shorter, and the adjacent line 13 expands to fill the space, an
asymmetry that complicated determining the start of the text 5 . Researchers debate the reading order:
Fischer assumed the short line 12 was the beginning (thinking the carver indented the first line) whereas
Horley argued line 11 likely starts the text, with line 12 being the final line fitted into the remaining gap 6
7 . The direction of reading is boustrophedon (alternating direction per line) as on other texts, but the
exact starting point remains uncertain 5 .
Physically, the inscription is in good condition with only minor damage: slight splitting and wear on the
thicker end (perhaps from being stood on the ground), and some surface pitting near where a bearer’s
thumb would rest 1 . Uniquely, the Staff has carved vertical stroke markers that serve as punctuation.
Fischer counted ~103 vertical bars on the staff 8 , which correspond to a special glyph (often labeled
№999) in transcription 9 . These strokes divide the text into sections or verses, essentially functioning as
segment dividers between sequences 8 10 . In other words, the engraver literally incised punctuation
marks (short vertical lines) at regular intervals, partitioning the long text. This is one of only two
rongorongo texts with such marks (the other being text T with a few bars) 8 . The presence of these
dividers suggests the Staff’s content was organized into discrete units - likely genealogical entries or chant
verses - rather than one continuous run-on sentence.
Segmentation of the Staff can also be inferred by certain glyph patterns. In particular, glyph 76 (a phallicshaped sign) and several anthropomorphic glyphs act as structural markers. The text is extremely dense
(over 2,200 glyphs 4 ), and glyph 76 appears hundreds of times (564 occurrences) 11 12 . Glyph 76 is
often attached to or following person glyphs (like the human figure glyph 200) in repetitive sequences 13 .
This repetition led early analysts to suspect a genealogical list: for example, on the Small Santiago tablet
(text G) a sequence runs 200 - personal name - 76 - personal name - 76 - personal name…, interpreted as
“Chief X, son of Y, son of Z…” 14 . By analogy, the Staff’s text seems to be segmented into genealogical
units where a name/title (often denoted by glyph 200 or a related figure) is followed by glyph 76 “begat”
linking to the next name, and so on 13 15 . Each such chain likely ends at a vertical divider (glyph 999),
before a new lineage segment begins. Indeed, the Staff’s dividers (999) tend to occur after sequences
containing glyph 76 and descendant markers, reinforcing that they separate genealogical entries or verse
lines 9 . In sum, the Staff is structured as a succession of genealogy phrases, demarcated by carved punctuation. The combination of glyph 200 (often depicting a person of high status) and glyph 76
(procreation/link) is a strong clue to these segment boundaries. Likewise, a female figure glyph 300 or an
elder figure glyph 500 may appear at certain segment starts, indicating a mother or an ancestral patriarch
in the lineage, respectively (discussed more below). Through these glyph clues and the physical dividers, we
can segment the Staff into a series of genealogical “verses” or name clusters, each likely corresponding to
one generation or one entry in a list (for example, a list of kings or chiefs).
Lineage and Procreation Cycles
All evidence points to the Staff being predominantly genealogical in content - essentially a long lineage
chant recording successive “begats”. Glyph 76, identified with the Rapanui words ai or fanau (“to copulate,
to procreate”), is the linchpin of this interpretation 13 16 . It functions as a relational marker meaning
“begotten by” or “child of” in these sequences 16 13 . The Staff features glyph 76 in chain-repetition: it
appears in almost every phrase, linking one name to the next. Statistically, 76 occurs ~564 times across the
Staff 11 , roughly one out of every four glyphs - an extraordinarily repetitive pattern consistent with a litany
of parentage. In contrast, narrative texts (like Aruku Kurenga, text B) have far fewer 76’s 17 . This heavy
concentration means the Staff’s text probably reads like “Person A begat Person B; Person B begat Person C;
Person C begat Person D; …” and so on, in a long chain 14 . On the small genealogy Tablet G, a fragmentary
sequence explicitly shows this pattern (ariki title 200, personal name, 76 “son of”, next name, 76, next
name…) 14 . The Staff appears to be the greatly extended version of that: a continuous “begat…begat…
begat” genealogy, presumably of dozens of generations.
Within these lineage cycles, we find specific glyphs that denote descendants or offspring, often
immediately following glyph 76 to specify the progeny. For instance, glyph 7 - a small anthropomorphic
figure - was read by Metoro (Jaussen’s informant) as “poki” (child) 18 and is interpreted as a “descendant”
marker 19 20 . Similarly, glyph 400 is another variant representing “children/offspring” - a small human
form conveying ui (young) or poki (child) in genealogical contexts 21 22 . In the Staff text, we see
sequences where glyph 76 is directly followed by glyph 7 or 400, essentially writing “begat [a] child/
descendant” as a formula. For example, a cluster 76-7-400 likely means “(he) begat a young offspring” 22 .
Such clusters may serve to emphasize a generational link or to introduce a list of children. Indeed, a
recurring micro-phrase on the Staff appears to be 76 + descendant indicator, sometimes ending with a
punctuation stroke - effectively marking the completion of one parent-to-child statement 9 . Additionally,
glyph 90 (a rounded form representing a distended abdomen) is associated with kōpū (belly), hapū
(pregnant) and the state of fullness 23 24 . In lineage sequences, 90 may appear alongside 76 to denote
pregnancy or birth - for instance, “fanau hapū” (“conceived in the womb”) - reinforcing the idea of a progeny
being born 25 24 . The combination of these signs paints a consistent picture: whenever a new generation
is mentioned, the text explicitly notes the procreative act or state (glyph 76) and often highlights the child or
pregnancy resulting (glyph 7, 400, or 90). This ensures the descent relationships are unambiguous in the
inscription.
To cross-verify the lineage interpretation, we also examine the titles and statuses that accompany
personal names in the chain. Glyph 200 - depicting a standing or seated human figure often with a
headdress - appears frequently and is thought to denote a high-status person (in Rapanui terms an ariki
or chief) 26 27 . Butinov and Knorozov long ago proposed glyph 200 is an ariki (chief/king) title used in
genealogies 28 27 , and later research has supported that: in many texts 200 precedes personal names
and “regularly appears in genealogical chains as a title or status marker” 28 29 . On the Staff, we expect
glyph 200 to introduce each male ancestor’s name - effectively labeling them as a chief or important person. Likewise, glyph 300, an anthropomorphic female figure (often with a pronounced abdomen or
breasts), likely denotes a woman or mother in genealogical contexts 30 31 . Glyph 300 “appears in
genealogies” when a female lineage or maternal role is referenced 31 - for example, if a queen or an
important mother of a line is mentioned, her name might be preceded by 300 to indicate her gender/status.
In a patriarchal list, 300 may be rarer, but its presence would signal a mother or a matriarch in the lineage
(perhaps if a reigning queen or a crucial female link needed recording). Meanwhile, glyph 500 is interpreted
as an elder or ancestor figure (tupuna, forebear) 32 33 . This sign could mark founding ancestors or
particularly old generations in the list. For instance, if the genealogy traces back to legendary forefathers,
those names might be accompanied by glyph 500 to denote their antiquity and status as “ancestors” 33 . In
the lexicon of rongorongo, glyph 500 encapsulates the concept of tupuna (ancestor) or koroua (elder) and
“represents seniority and ancestral authority” 33 34 . Thus, on the Staff one might find a sequence where
an origin ancestor (with glyph 500) begat a line of chiefs (glyph 200 each), and perhaps occasionally a noted
mother (glyph 300) appears. These title chains support a hierarchical progression: from a primordial
ancestor down through generations of chiefs (and the occasional queen or notable mother), all linked by
“begat” markers. The consistent use of 200, 300, 500 in appropriate contexts is strong corroborating
evidence for a genealogy. For example, if we see a section like 500 - 76 - 200 - Name - 76 - 200 - Name…,
we could interpret it as “Ancestor A begat Chief B, begat Chief C…” with 500 indicating A’s ancestral status
and 200 marking B and C as chiefs. Indeed, the presence of these glyphs exactly in the spots one would
expect titles (start of an entry) and the connector 76 exactly where one expects “son of” confirms that the
Staff is recording lineage and procreation cycles with remarkable consistency 27 31 . In summary, every
segment on the Staff is structured around a progenitive link: a parent (often flagged by a title glyph) “fans
out” a child (explicitly noted by descendant glyphs or implied by context), and this repeats generation after
generation. This interpretation - a genealogy list - is strongly supported by the internal evidence and has
high confidence among researchers 35 13 .
Thematic and Semantic Layering
Despite its formulaic nature, the Staff’s text may encode additional thematic layers beyond simple “A begat
B” statements. Researchers have noted certain repeating sub-sequences and symbolic motifs that suggest a
poetic or ritual structure superimposed on the genealogy. One such pattern is the cluster 76-7-400-999 (or
slight variations thereof) that seems to recur at regular intervals. This sequence, as discussed, reads as
something like “begat a child/offspring” followed by a section break 22 10 . In other words, many verses
might conclude with the phrase “and begat offspring,” before a new verse starts. The repetition of this stock
phrase gives the impression of a ritual refrain or closure used in the chant. It is akin to how in oral
genealogies or creation chants, a standard line like “and so begat sons and daughters” might be repeated
for each generation. The presence of glyph 999 (vertical divider) immediately after the 76-7-400
combination reinforces that this was an intentional verse-ending formula on the Staff 10 . This kind of
poetic cycle - each genealogical unit ending with a similar phrasing - would have aided memorization and
recital, making the chant more rhythmic and ceremonial.
Beyond genealogy, the Staff likely intertwines mythological and sacred concepts into the text, especially
toward the beginning or in special sections. Many Polynesian genealogies start with cosmogony, listing the
gods or primordial events before human generations. We see hints of this in the glyph inventory: for
example, glyph 610 (an oval shape) is thought to represent an “origin egg” or the beginning of creation
(timu, source). If glyph 610 appears at or near the start of the Staff, it could signal a cosmogonic opening,
describing the cosmic birth or the first ancestor emerging from an egg or void. Similarly, glyph 69 (often
depicted as a lizard) carries rich symbolic meaning: it was read as moko (lizard) and associated with the god
Hiro as well as the new moon in Rapa Nui lore. In rongorongo, glyph 69 seems to mark the start of a lunar
cycle on the Mamari tablet and is tied to renewal myths. If the Staff text includes glyph 69, it might be
invoking the myth of Hiro or a notion of renewal, blending mythic time into the genealogy. For instance,
one could imagine a line like “Hiro emerged at the new moon - (and) begat so-and-so…”, thereby rooting
the lineage in a mythic event. Another intriguing sign is glyph 800, identified as an octopus (he’e in
Polynesian). Octopus imagery in Polynesia often connotes the sea’s reach or creation myths (e.g. in some
myths an octopus lifts islands from the sea). On the Staff, any occurrence of glyph 800 might symbolize a
marine deity or cosmological concept - perhaps referencing the sea-god Tangaroa or the idea of
spreading offspring (tentacles as a metaphor for progeny). While we do not have direct confirmation that
800 appears on the Staff, its inclusion in the lexicon of this research suggests it’s considered in the semantic
palette of rongorongo. In short, cosmic and mythic motifs like the cosmic egg (610), the lizard/new-moon
(69), the octopus or great fish (800/710/730) might be interwoven especially at the genealogy’s start or at
points where human lineage connects back to divine origins.
Indeed, some researchers propose the Staff could begin with a creation chant segment before shifting
into pure genealogy. Steven Fischer, for example, believed the entire text consists of creation chants (“all the
birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth the sun…” in his reading) 36 . Although his overall
interpretation is debated, the imagery he cites - birds, fish, the sun - corresponds to actual glyphs that are
present on the Staff and carry mythic symbolism. Glyph 606 (a bird with a plural marker) combined with
glyph 76 and glyph 700 (fish) does literally occur on the Staff, and Fischer read one instance as “all the birds
copulated with the fish” 37 . A more accepted reinterpretation of that same sequence is rebus-based:
606.76.700 could mean “child of bird was slain (fish=victim)” 38 . Still, it’s notable that birds, fish, and the
sun (glyph 8) feature in the text - these could be not only genealogical metaphors but also references to
mythic actors. For example, in Rapa Nui tradition, seabirds often symbolize chiefs or souls, and “ika” (fish)
metaphorically means a war victim or can relate to creation (in some Polynesian myths, land or humans
spring from sea creatures). The line “birds and fish brought forth the sun” that Fischer imagined may be a
distorted echo of a genealogical record in which a person named “Bird” (Manu) begat someone, and at
some point a ra‘a (sun) glyph appears possibly as a name or title. We also see glyph 8 (ra‘a, the sun)
frequently at the start of lines or sections across tablets 39 . On the Staff, glyph 8 might function as a
celestial marker or a way to denote a new “day” or era in the lineage. If each verse began with glyph 8, for
instance, it could imply each generation is like a new rising sun - a poetic way to frame the genealogy in
cosmic terms. However, analysis of the Staff by Pozdniakov found that it does not overtly share the
structured lunar calendar sequences seen on Tablet C (Mamari) 40 . In Mamari, glyph 10 (moon) and
variants like 74, 78 mark the nights of the month in a tight cycle 41 , whereas the Staff shows no sign of the
30-night cycle or those specific calendrical glyph combinations. This indicates the Staff’s focus is
genealogical/mythic rather than calendrical; it doesn’t enumerate time in a month, but rather lineage
through generations. So while astronomical glyphs (sun, moon, stars) do appear on the Staff, they likely
serve symbolic or thematic roles (e.g. sanctifying a section, aligning an event with a celestial sign) rather
than forming a calendar.
Marine imagery, on the other hand, is prominent in the Staff and aligns with a potential theme of warfare or
sacrifice interlaced with the genealogy. Glyph 700 (fish, ika) occurs ~63 times on the Staff 42 , far more
than mere chance. This abundance led researchers like Knorozov to propose the Staff could be a “kohau
ika” - literally a “fish list,” which in Rapa Nui refers to war casualty lists 43 . In Rapanui language, ika means
“fish” but also figuratively “victim” (as in the phrase ko hau ika for slain warriors) 43 . The Staff’s repetitive
use of the fish glyph in sequences with 76 suggests a formula like “So-and-so, child of X, was a victim
(died)” 38 . In fact, the pattern (Name) - 76 - 700 likely means “the son of [Name] was killed” 38 . This interpretation provides a narrative layer of battle or sacrifice events overlaying the genealogy - perhaps
it’s not just who begat whom, but also who died or who was “taken as a fish.” The idea of listing battles,
heroes, and victims was raised by Guy (1998) in critique of Fischer 35 . Guy argued that if 76 is a patronymic
“son of,” then many sequences ending in a fish could mean those individuals were casualties, turning the
text into a chronicle of conflicts as well as lineage 35 . In support, glyph 600 (bird, manu) appears on the
Staff and in Fischer’s reading “all the birds…”, but under genealogical reading a bird could be a clan name or
title. For example, the supposed phrase “birds copulated with fish” can be read as “[the tribe] Manu - begat
* [the person who became a] fish (victim)” 37 . In other words, bird glyphs might identify certain lineages or
factions, while fish marks their demise. This paints a picture of possibly a genealogical war record: a
lineage of chiefs, each associated with certain epithets (bird names or the like), and notes that they died in
battle (fish/victim), generation after generation.
The Staff, therefore, might carry multiple layers of meaning: it is fundamentally a genealogy, but it is
stylized as a sacred chant, replete with refrains (“begat a child…”) and symbolic motifs for life and death. It
likely begins with a cosmogonic prologue referencing the origin of the lineage (cosmic egg, lunar deity,
etc.), then lists human generations in a steady pattern, and possibly records notable events (like deaths in
war) within that list via rebus symbols (fish for “killed”). It reads as both a family tree and a chant d’histoire.
Thematic elements of nature and cosmos - birds, fish, the sun, the sea - are woven in, giving the dry
genealogy a mythic-poetic resonance. These would have been meaningful to the chanters and listeners: e.g.
likening fallen warriors to fishes, or emphasizing fertility and continuity through repeated procreative
metaphors. In summary, the Staff’s text operates on at least two levels: a literal record of lineage (names
and parentage), and a figurative, poetic narrative of the tribe’s origin, survival, and possibly its struggles,
couched in metaphor and ritual language. This kind of semantic layering is typical of Polynesian oral
literature, where genealogies often double as cosmogonies and historical chronicles. The rongorongo script
captures that layering by using glyphs with double meanings (like 76 as both sexual act and lineage link,
700 as fish and victim, etc.) 38 , allowing the text to be simultaneously a straightforward genealogy and a
rich mythic poem.
Cross-Tablet Correlation
When comparing the Santiago Staff to other rongorongo texts, researchers find both common sign
sequences (indicating a unified script and shared formulae) and stark differences in content focus. Each
major tablet seems to represent a different genre of text (e.g. genealogy, voyage story, lunar calendar), yet
they all draw from the same pool of glyphs and grammatical rules 44 45 . The Staff (text I) is a prime
example of a genealogy-heavy text, and it contrasts most with narrative or calendrical texts like Aruku
Kurenga (text B) and Mamari (text C).
Compared to Aruku Kurenga (B): Tablet B is a narrative (likely mythic-historical) text recounting voyages
and place names, not a lineage list. Accordingly, Aruku Kurenga contains far fewer instances of the “begat”
glyph 76 17 . Where the Staff has 564 occurrences of 76 in a continuous chain 11 , Aruku Kurenga uses 76
only sparingly; its structure is built on repeating journey sequences rather than patronymic links 17 . This
indicates a thematic difference: Tablet B encodes a travelogue or legend, so it doesn’t list “A son of B son
of C…” repeatedly. Nonetheless, both texts share certain conventions. For example, glyph 32 (a divider
mark) appears in Aruku Kurenga to signal the start of repeated sequences 46 , and on the Staff a similar
function is served by its vertical bars and possibly glyph 32 if present 47 . More concretely, some lexical
items recur across B and I: glyph 6 (the “hand” affix) is used as a plural marker in both texts 48 . On
Tablet B, sequences like 600+6 (bird + hand) mean “birds (plural)” and refer to multiple beings 49 ; on the
Staff, we find analogous constructions (e.g. a glyph with an added small hand) to indicate plural or collective
groups 50 48 . This confirms that the same grammatical device (the plural suffix) was employed in a
genealogy context as well - perhaps to list “all the sons” or “the multitude of descendants” of a figure.
Another cross-text glyph is glyph 8 (sun): while on the Staff it may denote a sacred or temporal break, on
Aruku Kurenga glyph 8 also appears (often at line starts) likely as a temporal marker or start of a new
section 39 . These parallels give us confidence in our readings - seeing the same sign sequences in different
tablets but analogous roles (e.g. 606 “birds” on B and maybe on I) reinforces that the interpretation is not a
one-off. In short, Tablet B and the Staff share the same scriptural “grammar” but tell different kinds of
stories: B is like an epic with place-name lists, the Staff is like a genealogy with patronymic lists 17 . The
Staff’s lineage formulas (Name - 76 - Name…) are largely absent in B’s content, which aligns with B’s subject
being mythic voyages rather than family descent 51 . This observation helped confirm the meaning of
glyph 76: seeing it ubiquitous in I and G (genealogical texts) but scarce in B (travel text) supports that 76 is
indeed a genealogical connector, not a general-purpose verb that would appear in every context 52 53 .
Compared to Mamari (C): The Mamari tablet is famous for its lunar calendar segment - a repetitive
sequence enumerating the nights of the month with moon phases (glyph 10 in various shapes) and special
symbols for nights like Hua and Maure (Barthel glyphs 69, 70, 78, etc.) 41 . This calendar is highly structured:
essentially 30 repeating glyph clusters in a cycle, repeated 12 times for 12 months 54 . When we look at the
Staff, we find no evidence of a similar cyclical calendrical pattern. Pozdniakov’s analysis noted that the
Staff “has nothing in common with the rest of the corpus” except texts G and T 40 - meaning it shares no
long sequences with Mamari’s calendar or the “Grand Tradition” narrative tablets. In particular, the hallmark
of Mamari - sequences of moon (glyph 10) followed by varying attendant glyphs for each night - is absent
on the Staff. The Staff does contain glyph 10 (the basic moon shape) here and there, but not in the ordered
progression required to represent the nights of a month. Nor do we see the distinctive intercalary night
glyphs (Barthel 78 etc.) on the Staff. This lack of overlap was explicitly noted: “the Staff shares short phrases
with G and T… but nothing with the others” 40 . Therefore, we validate that the Staff is not a calendrical
text - it likely served a different purpose (genealogy/ritual) and so did not incorporate the calendar that
was recorded on Mamari. This differentiation underscores that rongorongo texts could be specialized:
Mamari records calendrical/religious knowledge of lunar cycles, while the Staff records genealogical/sacred
lineage knowledge. Each text type used unique combinations of glyphs suited to its topic (with some
overlap in general symbols, of course).
Overlap with Texts G, H, T: The closest affinities of the Santiago Staff are with the Small Santiago Tablet
(G) and probably Tablet T. Text G (also called Gv, Small Santiago verso) is a short inscription which Butinov
and Knorozov argued is a genealogy (they identified the same 200-76-... chain on G) 14 35 . Indeed, G’s
content seems like a miniature version of what’s on the Staff. Pozdniakov found that the Staff does share
some short phrases with G (and with T or Ta, a fragment of text T) 40 . Tablet T (the so-called Great
Washington tablet) is poorly understood, but it has a few vertical dividers like the Staff 8 , hinting it might
also contain genealogical or list-like material. The Staff and text T both having vertical bars suggests they
might belong to a similar genre (possibly lists or songs divided into verses). Meanwhile, text H (Large
Santiago) is part of Barthel’s “Grand Tradition” texts that share story sequences (H, P, Q, etc.), but the Staff
does not share content with H according to Pozdniakov 40 . This implies text H is a different genre (likely
narrative) despite also being found in Santiago. So the Staff stands apart from the Grand Tradition; its only
real textual “siblings” in terms of content are G and perhaps T (and possibly smaller fragments like text O
which might have a few parallel glyph strings, though those are narrative fragments). By comparing across
tablets, we gain confidence in our decipherment of key glyphs: for example, seeing glyph 76 + human
figures appear only in I, G, T (the lineage-type texts) and not in A, B, C, etc., solidifies the reading of 76 as “offspring/son of” 55 . Conversely, seeing glyph combinations from the calendar or the mythic voyage texts
absent on the Staff confirms that the Staff’s scribe was composing a different kind of text, not copying lines
from the known chants. This compartmentalization is important: it tells us that rongorongo was used for
multiple domains (history, religion, genealogy), and each tablet tends to stick to one domain. The Staff (I)
thus can be thought of as the primary exemplar of the genealogical/ancestral genre, just as Mamari (C)
exemplifies the calendar genre and Aruku Kurenga (B) the exploration myth genre 44 45 .
Despite differences in subject, there are common patterns that link the Staff with others: e.g. the use of
phrase separators. As mentioned, glyph 32 is a section marker on Aruku Kurenga 46 , and interestingly,
the lexicon notes that glyph 32 also appears on the Staff as a verse-beginning marker (perhaps at major
lineage transitions) 47 56 . Glyph 62, a small divider sign, is used across tablets as a minor break or
“comma” between phrases 57 . Its presence on multiple tablets (likely including the Staff) shows that the
scribes employed a consistent method of punctuation, even if the actual content differed. All these crosstable comparisons reinforce the notion that the rongorongo script was a unified system, and by
leveraging parallels between texts, we can decipher function and meaning. In summary, the Staff’s lineage
formulas can be directly compared to those on tablet G (a close match, confirming the patronymic
pattern) 14 ; they stand in deliberate contrast to tablet B’s travel formulas (highlighting the difference
between a genealogy and a journey list) 51 ; and they show no overlap with tablet C’s lunar formulas (so
we know the Staff’s purpose was not calendrical) 40 . The only overlaps are with tablets of the same
presumed genre (G, T), implying that the Staff, G, and perhaps T recorded genealogical or commemorative
lists, whereas other tablets recorded myths or rituals of other kinds 40 . This compartmentalization actually
boosts our confidence in reading the Staff: it means we don’t have to find moon phases or voyage
segments hidden in it - we can focus on lineage-related interpretations consistently, as the context dictates.
Narrative Structure Hypotheses
Taking into account the structural and thematic evidence, we can hypothesize about the narrative nature
of the Santiago Staff text. Several interpretations have been proposed:
* (A) Genealogical Chant of Kings/Chiefs: The leading hypothesis - supported by Butinov, Knorozov,
Pozdniakov, Guy, and the statistical patterns - is that the Staff is essentially a chant-style
genealogy. In this view, the text enumerates a line of ariki (kings or high chiefs) and their parentage
58 35 . It would likely start from some founding figure and progress generation by generation to
the current or recent chief. The format is reminiscent of Polynesian ’upu genealogies that were
recited at important occasions (for example, to affirm a chief’s legitimacy). The repetitive “begat X,
begat Y…” is exactly what one finds in oral genealogies across Polynesia. This hypothesis fits the
data: the dominance of glyph 76 and name sequences indicates genealogy; glyph 200 marking
names indicates chiefly titles; the respectful handling by Rapanui elders (who pointed to the sky and
treated the Staff as sacred when asked about it) suggests it “recalled something sacred” 59 - likely the
sacred ancestry of the island’s leaders. Thus, the Staff could be the written form of a royal lineage
chant used in coronation ceremonies or annual commemorations of ancestors. Its narrative
structure would then be a straightforward lineage, possibly punctuated by verses (each verse
covering a set number of generations or a particular branch). The inclusion of mythic symbols (sun,
etc.) at the start would tie the royal line to the gods, as is common in Polynesian genealogies (e.g.,
claiming descent from sky and earth or a creator deity). This scenario positions the Staff as a central
cultural artifact: the table of descent of Rapa Nui’s ruling clan, meant to be chanted from memory
with the Staff as a mnemonic prompt. The presence of structure markers (32, 999) and rhythmic repetition supports the idea that it was formatted for oral performance - each segment likely
corresponds to a chant line that a tangata rongorongo (reciter) would declaim in ritual settings.
* (B) Cosmogonic or Mythical Narrative: Steven Fischer’s interpretation (1990s) posited that the Staff
is not a list of people at all, but rather a series of creation chants describing how various beings
copulated and produced elements of the world (birds and fish producing the sun, etc.) 36 . In this
view, the text would be a cosmogony or epic akin to other Polynesian creation myths (for example,
the Tahitian creation chant where animals and gods procreate to form natural phenomena). Fischer
claimed to identify sequences on the Staff translating to phrases about animals and celestial bodies.
However, this hypothesis has low confidence today, as it conflicts with the genealogical structure
observed. As Guy (1998) and others argued, Fischer’s “all the birds copulated with the fish” reading
interprets glyph 76 in a literal sexual sense each time, which would render the text absurdly
repetitive in a myth context (hundreds of copulations) 35 . Moreover, Fischer’s reading had to
downplay the patronymic pattern that Butinov & Knorozov had identified. Still, it’s possible the Staff
includes some cosmogonic lines, especially at the beginning. Polynesian genealogies often open
with myth: e.g., “In the beginning, Sky (Rangi) mated with Earth (Papa) and begat so-and-so…”,
eventually leading to human ancestors. The Staff could follow this format: the first few lines might
describe primal events in metaphorical language (hence Fischer saw birds, fish, sun imagery), and
then segue into naming actual ancestors. In fact, Fischer’s example 606.76.700 can be re-read as “Soand-so, child of Bird, was slain (fish)” 38 - perhaps “Bird” is not a literal bird but a nickname or
totemic name of an ancestor, and “was slain” marks an event. This shows that a cosmogonic
interpretation and a genealogical one aren’t mutually exclusive: mythic-sounding glyph
combinations on the Staff might actually refer to human individuals with animal names or to events
described poetically. The balance of evidence, however, favors the lineage reading with only a brief
cosmogonic introduction. If the Staff were exclusively a creation myth, we’d expect more variety in
content and less rigid structure. Instead, we see relentless 76 usage, which is more characteristic of
genealogies than narrative myths. Therefore, while Fischer’s creation chant idea highlights the
presence of metaphoric language, the Staff is unlikely to be purely mythological story. It is safer to
say the Staff contains a genealogy couched in mythic terms, rather than a standalone creation
myth. Confidence in the purely cosmogonic hypothesis is low, given it’s largely one researcher’s view
and contradicts the prevailing patronymic interpretation 35 .
* (C) Chronological List of Battles or Events (War Chronicle): Another compelling hypothesis
(building on the work of Pozdniakov and Guy) is that the Staff doubles as a chronicle of war or
important events in addition to listing names. The frequent “fish = victim” glyph strongly suggests
that many names are annotated with the fact that they died (likely in battle) 43 60 . Guy proposed
that if text G is a genealogy of chiefs, perhaps the Staff extends that and includes references to
battles - essentially a list of reigns and their fates 60 . Each segment could be a reign: e.g., “Chief A,
son of B (who was son of C…), (did X), died in battle Y.” The Staff’s vertical dividers might even
separate reigns or battles. Supporting this, the term kohau îka in historical accounts refers to “lines
of fish” meaning lines memorializing those killed in war 43 . The Staff might actually be one of those
kohau îka, commemorating fallen warriors or chiefs. For example, it could list all the victories of an
ariki: “So-and-so, son of so-and-so - (enemy) was killed; His son X - (enemy) was killed; …” repeatedly.
Or it could list the lineage of kings with notes on their deaths: “King A (child of King B) was slain,
King B (child of King C) was slain, King C…” and so on - effectively a genealogy intertwined with a
death roll. This hypothesis explains both the genealogical form and the fish (death) markers, and is
plausible given Rapa Nui’s history of internecine wars. If true, the Staff’s narrative structure would be chronological: each chief’s entry includes his parentage and how he died, then the next chief. It
would be like a combined king list and obituary record. The presence of certain glyphs might
denote specific battle names or ritual terms (though we haven’t deciphered those yet). The
confidence for the war-list hypothesis is moderate to high, since it neatly accounts for glyph 700’s
role and aligns with known Rapanui terminology 43 60 . We must note that this doesn’t contradict
the genealogical nature - it enriches it. The Staff could simultaneously be a genealogy of rulers and a
chronicle of their fates. In fact, Polynesian chants often include such info in stylized form (e.g.
mentioning if a chief “went to Hiva” as a metaphor for death, etc.). Therefore, it’s very plausible that
the Staff’s genealogy has a narrative through-line of conflict or ritual sacrifice.
* (D) Initiation or Ritual Sequence: A more speculative idea is that the Staff’s text was used in an
initiation ceremony or an annual ritual, not just kept as an archive. The repetitive, verse-divided
nature, and the fact it’s on a staff (an object one could hold while reciting), suggest a performative
context. Perhaps a priest or the king would hold the staff and recite the lineage during important
ceremonies (such as the installation of a new king, who is reminded of his ancestors). In an initiation
context, the text might not be only genealogy; it could include exhortations or ritual phrases,
possibly indicated by certain non-genealogical glyphs. We know glyph 32 and glyph 62 act like
punctuation - they might separate sections like stanzas in a chant 47 57 . It’s possible that between
genealogical stanzas, there were standard ritual refrains or invocations (for example, prayers to the
gods of each generation). If any glyph can be identified as a repetitive refrain marker, that could
support this. Some candidates might be specific highly frequent glyphs beyond 76 - for instance, if
glyph 8 (sun) starts many segments, maybe each segment began with a phrase like “Day has
dawned upon [Name], son of [Name]…”. Without a full decipherment, this remains conjecture, but
the verse structure and sacred context strongly imply an intended oral performance. The Staff
itself, being a royal staff, could have been held by the king during rituals, with the glyphs serving as a
cue for recitation (or at least as a symbol of the king’s ancient lineage). So the Staff’s narrative might
have been performed as a sequence of genealogical verses to induct a new ruler or to honor
ancestors at certain times of the year. This hypothesis doesn’t change the content (genealogy), but it
situates it in a ritual narrative framework - essentially that the Staff is both a record and a script for
ritual chanting. The confidence here is hard to quantify (since it’s about use rather than deciphered
content), but given that Rapanui rongorongo was said to be “to recite, to chant” in meaning, and
considering the reverence shown to the Staff by islanders in 1870 59 , it is quite plausible that this
text was an initiatory genealogy chant. Every aspect - repetition, sectioning, mnemonic devices -
supports an oral-performance purpose.
In evaluating these hypotheses, the Phase_Confidence can be summarized as follows:
* The Staff as a genealogical chant of chiefly lineage: High confidence - Supported by multiple
independent analyses and the overwhelming structural evidence 58 35 . The core deciphered
elements (76 = “son of”, 200 = chief, etc.) align perfectly with this narrative. This is currently the
accepted interpretation framework.
* Inclusion of cosmogonic (creation myth) content: Moderate confidence in a limited form - It’s likely
the genealogy has a mythic origin section, but the theory that the whole text is a cosmogony
(Fischer’s view) is Low confidence (widely refuted) 35 . We expect some mythological references but
not a full creation story narrative.
* War casualty list or historical chronicle component: High confidence for inclusion of war-victim
markers (the fish glyph) - The repetition of glyph 700 and the known metaphor of “ika” for slain
persons strongly point to this layer 61 60 . It’s very plausible the genealogy doubles as a chronicle
of battles or deaths of each figure. This interpretation is supported by reputable scholars
(Pozdniakov, Guy) as a correction to Fischer, hence taken seriously.
* Initiation/ritual usage: Moderate confidence - We infer this from context rather than deciphered
text. The structure is certainly chant-like and the object is regalia, which makes a ritual use likely, but
we don’t have explicit textual lines saying “and then the ceremony did X.” Still, ethnographic context
(the respectful pointing to the sky) suggests the islanders themselves associated the Staff with
something sacred, possibly recitations of ancestral lore 59 . Thus we can reasonably surmise it was
used in ritual, even if we can’t “read” an initiation instruction in the glyphs yet.
In conclusion, the most likely narrative structure of the Santiago Staff is that of a genealogical chronicle:
it reads as a chant listing a dynasty or clan lineage from mythic beginnings, through each successive
generation, possibly noting key events (like each leader’s demise), structured in verses for ceremonial
chanting. It does not seem to contain free prose or mythical anecdotes beyond the genealogical framework
* instead it is highly formulaic, which is exactly what one expects from a memorized genealogy or litany.
Each “verse” (between the vertical bars) probably corresponds to one generation or a set number of
generations, making the chant easier to perform. Glyphs that act like punctuation (32, 62) further support a
verse-and-chorus rhythm in the text 47 57 . This interpretation satisfies essentially all observed features
of the Staff. Any remaining uncertainties (like the exact identification of personal names or the precise role
of some less common glyphs) do not detract from the overall understanding that this is a structured,
lineage-based composition.
Figure: Close-up of a section of the Santiago Staff, showing several glyphs carved in relief on the wooden surface.
The Staff’s text is arranged in long lines along the staff’s curvature. Notable here are human-shaped glyphs
(indicative of people or deities) and the repeating forms which exemplify the script’s consistent style. Such details
illustrate the finely executed glyphs and support the identification of certain shapes (e.g. anthropomorphic figures
and geometric signs) that correspond to the key glyphs (200, 76, etc.) discussed in the analysis.

In the table above, each glyph chain is linked to an interpretive layer of the Staff’s text. We see that the
highest-confidence readings are those pertaining to genealogical structure and basic meanings - for
example, the patronymic chain (200…76…76…) and the use of vertical bars are essentially confirmed
features of the text 58 8 . These form the backbone of understanding the Staff. The identification of “fish = victim” in context is also high confidence, as it is backed by both linguistic insight and the sheer frequency
of glyph 700 on the Staff 43 .
Mid-level confidence items include the formulaic phrases (like 76-7-400) which we infer from repeated
patterns and comparative linguistics, and the presence of an origin myth segment which is suggested by
internal logic and partial evidence from other sources. These interpretations are very plausible but would
benefit from direct confirmation via reading more of the text (which may happen as decipherment
progresses).
Lower-confidence or tentative aspects are those that depend on unconfirmed presence of certain glyphs or
very specific uses - such as how exactly glyph 8 was used on the Staff, or whether a particular queen’s name
is included. These do not undermine the overall reading, but they remind us that some details of the Staff’s
narrative await further validation when a full transliteration and translation can be attempted in the future.
In summary, Phase 5.7 analysis confirms that the Santiago Staff’s inscription is a multi-layered genealogical
chant, with an internal structure optimized for oral performance and a content scope that likely spans from
mythic origins to historical events in the lineage. The decipherment work to date, corroborated by cross-text
comparisons and indigenous clues, gives us a coherent picture of this text. As such, the Staff stands out as a
keystone for understanding rongorongo’s ability to record complex genealogical and historical information
in the idiom of sacred poetry 55 60 . The confidence level for the core interpretation (genealogy of chiefs
with patronymic markers) is extremely high, approaching a point we might call confirmed decipherment
of that aspect. Further nuances - like specific personal names, exact mythic references, or whether it
doubles as a battle chronicle - are areas of active research, but even those have strong supporting
hypotheses as outlined above. Each phase of analysis tightens the understanding, and here in Phase 5.7 we
have integrated structural, semantic, and comparative evidence to decode the Staff’s story: a story of
descent and destiny, carved in wood, that the people of Rapa Nui once held so sacred that it was literally
pointed out under the heavens to indicate its cosmic significance 59 .
