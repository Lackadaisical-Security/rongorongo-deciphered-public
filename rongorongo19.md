Understood. I will now perform an in-depth review and synthesis of all 17 research documents along with the accompanying glyph lexicons and reference materials to establish exactly how far the decipherment has progressed. I’ll document the current methodology, key hypotheses, confirmed interpretations (such as the lunar calendar and genealogical markers), and any ambiguities or competing theories that still remain.

This will give us a precise foundation for continuing the decipherment work with a fully informed strategy. I’ll let you know once this full review is complete.


# Rongorongo Decipherment: Comprehensive Synthesis and Status (2025)

## Introduction

The **Rongorongo script** of Easter Island (Rapa Nui) remains largely undeciphered, yet decades of research have yielded **partial breakthroughs** and a clearer picture of its content and structure. Rongorongo consists of \~15,000 glyphs on a few dozen wooden artifacts (tablets, a staff, etc.), carved in an alternating direction (**reverse boustrophedon**) reading order. The symbols are highly pictorial – stylized humans, animals, plants, celestial symbols, and geometric shapes – and were likely used by a small priestly elite as a ceremonial **mnemonic device**. No bilingual “Rosetta Stone” exists, and the Rapa Nui oral tradition was severely disrupted in the 19th century, making decipherment challenging.

**No full translation is yet possible**, but researchers have **identified certain glyphs and sequences with confident meanings**. Notably, one segment on the Mamari tablet was recognized as a **lunar calendar** (the only portion of text widely agreed to be deciphered in function). Other recurring patterns suggest **genealogies, cosmogonic chants, and lists**. By synthesizing multiple methodologies – from linguistic analysis and rebus iconography to mythological and comparative study – scholars have begun to **“read” Rongorongo in broad strokes**, even if a verbatim phonetic reading remains elusive. This report assesses the current status of the decipherment project, detailing **which glyphs/sequences are understood, the methods applied, points of debate, contributions of key texts**, connections to Rapa Nui culture, and insights from comparative scripts.

## Deciphered Glyphs and Sequences (High-Confidence)

Several **glyphs and recurring sequences have been deciphered with high confidence** through cross-analysis of the texts and Rapa Nui cultural knowledge. The table below summarizes key glyphs, their proposed meanings, evidence supporting the interpretation, and confidence level:

| **Glyph ID** | **Proposed Meaning**                                                            | **Evidence (Method)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Confidence**                                                                         |
| -----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       **10** | Moon / Night (crescent symbol)                                                  | Pictographic crescent shape; forms the backbone of the Mamari **lunar month sequence**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **High** (well-attested in calendar)                                                   |
|      **152** | Full moon (complete moon)                                                       | Distinct round glyph in Mamari’s calendar identified as “old woman lighting oven in sky” (full moon myth); occurs at correct position (mid-month)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **High** (unique icon & context)                                                       |
|       **76** | Procreation marker (“to copulate” / *‘ai*) – denotes **“begat / offspring of”** | Phallic glyph widely repeated in genealogical sequences. Functions as a relational link: e.g. *A 76 B* = “A mated with B” or “A, child of B”. Supported by Rapanui word *‘ai* (sex) and its role connecting parents in chants.                                                                                                                                                                                | **High** (shape + formulaic use across texts)                                          |
|      **200** | High-ranking person / **Chief** (*ariki*)                                       | Human figure appearing at heads of genealogies. In Small Santiago tablet G, a repeating pattern of **200–76–Name** suggested 200 = a title (“king”). The updated lexicon confirms *ariki* (“chief”) for glyph 200. Appears in Aruku Kurenga as leader of the migration (Hotu Matuʻa).                                                                                                                         | **High** (recurrent context as leaders)                                                |
|      **700** | **Fish** (*ika*) – by pun also “victim”/dead person                             | Pictograph of a fish; Rapanui *ika* means *fish* and figuratively a war **victim**. On the Staff, 700 in phrases like X 76 700 likely means “X… was killed (became a victim)”. In mythic sequences, read literally as fish (one half of a primal pairing).                                                                                                                                                    | **High** (clear image + known pun usage)                                               |
|      **606** | “Flock of birds” (plural *manu*)                                                | Composite glyph (appears as a doubled bird figure). Interpreted as plural **birds** – lexicon gives *puhi manu* “birds collectively”. In Fischer’s reading: “all the birds”. Often precedes 76 on the Staff, acting as a subject meaning “birds (in general)” in cosmogonic lines.                                                                                                                            | **Moderate** (iconography + context; assumed plural marker)                            |
|       **32** | Section or **verse divider**                                                    | A unique glyph marking **segment breaks**. On the Great Santiago Staff, vertical lines (glyph 32) separate over 100 repetitive sections. On Aruku Kurenga (Text B), a similar sign appears at the start of each of the three voyage sequences. Likely a **structural punctuation** indicating a new chapter or list entry.                                                                                    | **High** (consistent positional use)                                                   |
|        **9** | **Sand, earth** (*oneone*) – denotes Anakena beach                              | Simple geometric form. Metoro (19th c. informant) read this glyph as “**one one**” (Rapanui *oneone* = sand/earth). In Aruku Kurenga’s route lists, glyph 9 appears at the end of the path, marking the **sand beach of Anakena** (the island’s only sandy bay) where voyages land.                                                                                                                           | **High** (Metoro’s gloss + correct mythic context)                                     |
|        **7** | **Child / offspring** (*poki*) – also plural “young people”                     | Small human figure glyph. Metoro recited it as “**poki**” (child). In Aruku Kurenga it leads the second sequence representing the **seven young scouts** (collectively the “offspring” of the chief). Suggests glyph 7 means *poki* (child/descendant), used as a **group marker** for youth. (Possibly combined with a “hand” sign indicating plural many.)                                                  | **Moderate** (Metoro’s reading fits context; specific usage as plural marker inferred) |
|       **13** | **Cave / tomb** (*Ana*, *Avanga*)                                               | Glyph showing a cavity-like shape. Occurs only in Aruku’s second voyage sequence, where one scout dies and is buried. Metoro identified glyph 13 as “**avanga**” (cave) and even named the deceased scout “Kūkūʻu” when seeing it. This strongly indicates glyph 13 denotes a **tomb/cave**, marking the episode of the buried scout.                                                                        | **High** (direct native gloss matching legendary event)                                |
|       **11** | **Bird** (*manu*) (specifically relating to “bird” place)                       | Bird-like figure. Appears at the end of Aruku sequences, presumably referencing **Anakena** (“cave of the **birds**”). Researchers link glyph 11 to *manu* (bird) because Anakena’s name contains “bird” and a bird glyph would cleverly signify that to initiated readers. Variants of glyph 11 on other tablets also correlate with bird imagery or the deity Makemake (bird-man).                          | **Moderate** (iconographic inference, fits etymology of place)                         |
|        **8** | **Sun** or star (celestial body)                                                | A spoked circle/star glyph. In the Staff’s procreation sequences, glyph 8 is read as “sun” – e.g. “birds ♂ fish ⇒ **sun**”. Likely represents the **sun** in cosmogonic myths (or a star in some contexts). Its position (often as an “offspring” in creation triads) supports this meaning. **Note:** Some debate exists if it’s specifically the sun or a star; context suggests the sun in known examples. | **Moderate** (mythic context, plausible celestial icon)                                |
|       **40** | **Water** (*vai* – water, or *tai* – sea)                                       | Wavy horizontal line glyph. By shape it denotes liquid; a Rapanui glyph list from Jaussen recorded a similar sign as *vai* (water). Also interpreted as *tai* (sea) in some lexicons. Not yet tied to a specific text passage, but likely appears in contexts of sea or rain.                                                                                                                                 | **Moderate** (iconographic; attested in wordlist, but rarely contextualized in texts)  |

**Sequences/Clusters:** In addition to individual signs, a few **longer glyph sequences have been “decoded” or linked to known information**:

* **Lunar Calendar Sequence (Mamari Tablet, lines Ca6–Ca8):** A sequence of \~30 glyph clusters corresponding to the 30 nights of the traditional Rapa Nui lunar month. This includes recognizable patterns like repeated crescents for consecutive nights and special forms for new moon and full moon. Scholars matched this sequence to 28 named nights plus 2 intercalary nights recorded ethnographically, confirming its calendrical nature. *Status:* **Deciphered in meaning** – each glyph group is identified as a specific night name or phase (e.g. *Hiro*, *Kokore*, *Maure*, *Mutu*). This was the **breakthrough “Rosetta” fragment** that proved Rongorongo could encode real information.

* **Genealogical List Pattern (Small Santiago Tablet G, lines Gv5–6):** A repetitive chain discovered by Butinov & Knorozov (1950s), where a figure glyph alternates with glyph 76 in a pattern suggestive of **“Name\_1 son of Name\_2; Name\_2 son of Name\_3; …”**. They posited glyph 200 as a title or name (likely “chief”) and glyph 76 as “son of”. While the actual names are unknown, the structure strongly implies a **king list or genealogy**. *Status:* **Structurally deciphered** (function identified), lending credence to glyph 200 = *ariki* and glyph 76 = lineage marker.

* **Cosmogonic “Procreation” Formula (Great Santiago Staff, text I):** The Staff’s 2320-glyph single line is divided by tall **section marks**, each segment often containing a triad like **X–76–Y … Z**. Fischer (1990s) interpreted this as a repeated phrase *“X copulated with Y; produced Z”* – essentially a **creation chant** listing mythic unions. For example, one segment reads as “all the birds ♂ fish ⇒ sun”. Whether or not every section fits this exact formula (Fischer’s reading has been critiqued; see below), it’s clear the staff text is heavily formulaic and dominated by genealogical/cosmogonic content (glyph 76 appears **564 times**, roughly 25% of all signs). *Status:* **Formula identified** (repetitive procreative sequences), though the *full mythological narrative* is still debated. It established that Rongorongo could encode **repetitive stanzaic texts** (likely chants or lists of ancestors) rather than free prose.

* **“Three Voyages” Migration Cycle (Aruku Kurenga Tablet B):** Recent analysis indicates Tablet B contains three nearly identical sequences, each encoding a chapter of the Rapa Nui **origin legend** of how the island was discovered and settled. The first segment corresponds to the exploration by *Hau-Maka* (finding the island and the sandy beach at **Anakena**), the second to the journey of the **seven scouts** (who bury one comrade in a cave), and the third to the main voyage of King **Hotu Matuʻa** bringing the people to Rapa Nui. Each sequence is led by a distinctive glyph (“A” for Hau-Maka, “B” for the scouts, “C” for Hotu Matuʻa) and followed by the same series of place-name glyphs (coastal landmarks ending in the sand/beach symbol). The few differences – e.g. glyph 13 (cave/tomb) appears only in the second sequence, marking the scout’s burial – align perfectly with the legend’s details. *Status:* **Highly plausible decipherment** – the correspondence with oral tradition is so strong that researchers are confident Tablet B is a mnemonic record of the **“Hau-Maka and Hotu Matuʻa” saga**. This reading identifies multiple glyphs (chief, child, sand, cave, bird, etc. as listed above) and demonstrates the text’s overall meaning (a structured narrative of voyages).

These successes underscore that Rongorongo, though still not readable in full, **conveys recognizable content**. Researchers can now point to certain glyphs and sequences and say, *“This is a list of moon nights”*, or *“This denotes a genealogy or mythic sequence”*, with considerable confidence. Each deciphered element becomes a foothold for interpreting other texts. For example, knowing glyph 152 is *“full moon”* and glyph 76 links names as *“offspring of”* allows us to scan other tablets for these signs and infer when a passage might be calendrical or genealogical in nature.

## Methodologies Used in Decipherment

Deciphering Rongorongo has required a **multi-faceted approach**, combining internal analysis of the script with external knowledge of language, culture, and even other writing systems. Key methodologies include:

* **Internal Pattern Analysis (Structural/Genealogical Approach):** Early cryptographic analysis by Butinov & Knorozov treated the unknown text like a code, searching for **repeating patterns and syntax**. This led to identifying genealogical structures on tablet G by noticing an alternating pattern (Name – 76 – Name). By treating glyph frequency and sequence as one would in code-breaking, researchers isolate recurring formulas (e.g. the triadic phrases on the Staff, or the three-fold repetition on tablet B). Identifying such **structural repetition** was “one of the first steps in unraveling the script’s structure”, revealing probable ligatures and confirming that Rongorongo texts are not random but follow **formulaic templates**. This method provided evidence that the script encodes language-like information (lists, genealogies, etc.) rather than mere pictures.

* **Lunar Calendar Correlation (Astronomical/Ethnographic Approach):** A major breakthrough came from aligning glyph sequences with the known **Rapa Nui calendar**. Thomas Barthel in 1958 recognized the pattern of 29–30 repeating glyphs on the Mamari tablet as the nights of the lunar month. By cross-referencing 19th-century records of month and night names (collected by Thomson in 1886) with the glyph order, scholars matched specific glyphs to specific night names. For example, the sequence of four identical crescent glyphs was linked to the four consecutive *Kokore* nights, and a unique glyph in the 11th position corresponded to *Atua* (a special night meaning “spirit”). This **cross-correlation with known cultural data** definitively anchored glyphs in real world referents. The calendar decipherment demonstrated the value of ethnographic context and showed that Rongorongo could encode technical information (astronomical rules for inserting leap nights) in a structured way. The same approach is now applied to other domains: for instance, if a tablet is suspected to list **ancient chiefs**, researchers compare the pattern of names to the known king list of Rapa Nui to see if any alignment emerges.

* **Mythological and Oral Tradition Correlation:** Given that Rongorongo likely recorded chants, genealogies, and myths, scholars have mined Rapa Nui’s **oral literature** for clues. A prime example is the **Atua Matariri** chant (a cosmogonic genealogy) which contains repeated phrases of the form “X ki ‘ai ki roto ki Y, ka pu te Z” – “X by copulating with Y produced Z”. This mirrors the triadic formula observed on the Staff and other texts. Steven Fischer explicitly linked his interpretation of the Staff as a creation chant to this structure, suggesting the tablet was essentially encoding the same *“X mated with Y begat Z”* pattern found in Polynesian mythic chants. In the case of Aruku Kurenga (tablet B), scholars used island **legend** to decode the sequences: knowing the story of Hau-Maka, the seven scouts, and Hotu Matuʻa, they expected to find references to key elements (e.g. the sand beach, the burial cave, etc.) and indeed discovered the corresponding glyphs in the text. In practice, researchers will hypothesize, *“If this section is about the scouts, there should be a ‘seven’ or ‘youth’ marker, and a tomb glyph for the dead scout.”* The discovery of glyph 7 (*poki*, child) and glyph 13 (cave/tomb) in the second sequence validated this approach. Essentially, **mythic and historical narratives act as de facto decryption keys** – by aligning glyph sequences with known chants or legends, the meaning of those sequences becomes clear. This method assumes Rongorongo content closely follows oral tradition (an assumption supported by multiple findings).

* **Rebus and Iconographic Readings:** Many glyphs are interpreted via the **rebus principle** or visual symbolism – a hallmark of early writing systems also seen here. Scholars ask, *“What does this symbol look like, and could that image stand for a concept or word in Rapa Nui?”* For example, the fish glyph clearly depicts a fish; knowing *ika* means *fish* and metaphorically *victim*, they deduced those meanings for glyph 700. A crescent shape denotes *“moon/night”*. A figure with a large round head (glyph 152) was interpreted as the **full moon** via the local “woman-in-the-moon” metaphor. These are classic **logographic** or pictographic readings. In other cases, a glyph might be used not for what it literally is, but for a word it **sounds like** (acrophonic or pun usage). For instance, Metoro’s reading of a certain glyph as *“one one”* (sand) suggests the sign had a shape evoking sand or earth and was used as a **phonetic pun** for *oneone*. Similarly, a small humanoid glyph read as *poki* (child) might depict a child to indicate the word “child” – but on tablet B it doubles as the name of a place (Mahaki, tied to the concept of an offspring or substitute). This shows one glyph can carry **multiple layers**: a general meaning (“child”) and a specific encoded name (a place linked to a child figure) depending on context. The **bird glyph (glyph 11)** at the end of the voyage sequences is another rebus: it stands for the word *manu* (*bird*), hinting at Anakena (“Bird’s Cave”) without spelling it out. Decipherers thus rely on Rapa Nui language’s penchant for metaphor and multiple meanings. They also incorporate knowledge of Polynesian iconography (e.g. the **bird-man** motif for the god Makemake) to guess certain signs might represent deities or ritual concepts. This **iconographic method** has successfully identified many glyph meanings (see table above) and is often cross-checked with other methods – for example, once the *meaning* “full moon” was proposed for glyph 152 from its imagery, it was confirmed by its position in the calendar sequence. Rebus readings were likely a core feature of how Rongorongo was devised, much as in ancient Egyptian or early alphabetic scripts.

* **Phonetic/Syllabic Analysis:** A more controversial approach tries to find phonetic values for glyphs or glyph components, treating Rongorongo as a potential **syllabary**. The sign inventory (\~52 core signs once variants are accounted for) suggests it *could* operate on a syllabic level, since \~50 signs is comparable to the size of known syllabaries. Scholars like Konstantin Pozdniakov have used **computational statistics** to argue for a reduced glyph set that might correspond to syllables, and even proposed pairings of signs that could share a base sound with different vowels. On the fringe, independent researcher Nikolai Rjabchikov has attempted direct phonetic readings: for instance, he claimed a sequence of two particular glyphs (Barthel #6 followed by #44) spells the name “**Hata**” (a Rapa Nui king). He assigned these glyphs phonetic values based on presumed acrophony and their appearance in contexts thought to mention King Hotu Matuʻa’s lineage. However, such readings are not widely accepted, as they often rely on tenuous letter-by-letter guessing. Fischer’s 1990s decipherment attempt also incorporated phonetics – he speculated that a hand-like element on a bird glyph signified the plural *mau* (by a Tahitian homophone), or that certain glyphs could be read as syllables (adjusting meanings of the fish glyph between “fish” and a womb depending on context). These linguistic leaps have drawn criticism, but they keep alive the possibility that **some glyphs do double-duty as phonograms** (for sounds) in addition to being logograms. The current lexicon treats most values as provisional *Rapanui words* rather than pure sounds – e.g. glyph 76 = *‘ai* – but acknowledges that phonetic play (like using *manu* “bird” glyph to hint at the sound \*ma/*maka* in Makemake) could be part of the script’s construction. In sum, phonetic analysis is employed carefully and usually in tandem with rebus meanings – any proposed phonetic value must make sense across all occurrences of that glyph. No full phonetic decipherment exists yet, but partial phonetic clues are emerging via consistent glyph–word correlations (e.g. glyph 40 likely = *vai* “water” from both shape and Metoro’s hints).

* **Computational and Digital Tools:** Modern researchers leverage digital technology to complement traditional methods. Corpora of Rongorongo texts have been encoded, allowing quick **searching for glyph sequences** and frequency analysis. For example, by computer-searching the corpus, one finds that **glyph 9 (sand)** often occurs at phrase ends in multiple texts that seem to discuss places or settlements, reinforcing its interpretation as “sand/landfall”. Likewise, algorithms detect when a sequence of glyphs on one tablet recurs on another, even if slightly modified. A recent finding was that a phrase on Aruku Kurenga’s verso appears also on the Berlin Tablet O, hinting at a shared chant or proverb used in different contexts. Such cross-text matches mean any interpretation of that sequence must work for both instances, providing a consistency check. Image-analysis tools (like high-res photos, 3D scans) also help by clarifying faint glyphs and revealing carving details, ensuring we have accurate readings of the signs. **Statistical models** assess whether glyph distributions resemble linguistic patterns: for instance, the absence of high-frequency short “function” signs (like Polynesian articles *te, ki*) was noted by Knorozov as evidence of either a condensed telegraphic style or a non-phonetic script. Computer models have further confirmed the **modular nature** of texts – identifying over a hundred repeated sequences across the corpus that likely represent stock phrases or lists. These findings align with the idea of Rongorongo as comprised of **reusable formulae** rather than unique narratives each time. In the ongoing project, a **digital lexicon** of glyphs (with fields for proposed meaning, phonetic value, source, etc.) is continually updated. This allows researchers to quickly verify, for example, all contexts where a given glyph occurs, or to test a hypothetical reading by plugging it into different sequences to see if they yield coherent results. Essentially, computation accelerates the hypothesis-testing process that in Barthel’s day had to be done manually.

* **Comparative Script Studies:** Although Rongorongo developed in isolation (radiocarbon dating confirms it predates European contact and wasn’t copied from any known script), scholars draw on analogies from other writing systems to guide their approach. Rongorongo’s mix of **pictographic signs with possible phonetic uses** is reminiscent of early **Sumerian cuneiform** and **Egyptian hieroglyphs**, which began as drawings of objects and later came to represent sounds and abstract concepts. For instance, just as Egyptian uses a bird image to signify the sound “A” (sparrow hieroglyph for aleph) or as a determinative for “bird” category, Rongorongo’s bird glyph might represent the idea “bird” or the name of a bird (like Makemake) or even a syllable if used acrophonically. Understanding this **multi-functionality** of symbols in other scripts has encouraged a “both/and” mindset for Rongorongo (glyphs can carry several layers of meaning, not exclusively one sound or one word). Comparative data is also used to bolster interpretations: for example, listing royal names with a repeated “son of” is extremely common in ancient king lists (Egyptian, Mesopotamian, etc.), so finding that structure in tablet G made immediate sense to epigraphers. Similarly, the idea of a **creation chant** with successive generations has parallels in many mythologies worldwide, lending plausibility to Fischer’s overall premise (even if his specific readings were questioned). Researchers have even looked at how **independent inventions** of writing (like the **Proto-Sinaitic** alphabet or the **Glagolitic** script of medieval Slavs) often draw from local iconography and acrophonic word play. Rongorongo likely followed a comparable path: its inventors took familiar symbols (fish, birds, crescent moon, etc.) and assigned them meanings or sounds based on Rapanui words and myths. Unlike glagolitic or Sinaitic scripts, however, Rongorongo did not simplify into a purely phonetic alphabet – it remained a complex hybrid. Still, the **universal principles** of early writing (pictorial signs, rebus puns, syntactic markers) are clearly at work. Comparative studies thus provide a conceptual framework (e.g. expecting determinative-like markers such as a **generic human figure for “person/name”** akin to how Egyptian uses a man determinative after personal names) which indeed appears in Rongorongo (glyph 200 as a generic *ariki* before personal names). Overall, while no direct lineage exists between Rongorongo and any Old World script, these analogies help decipherers ask the right questions and recognize similar solutions that human minds have used elsewhere when grappling with encoding language in images.

By **fusing all these methodologies**, the decipherment project has made steady progress. Each approach cross-validates the others: a statistical pattern suggests a meaning which a mythological reference then confirms; a visual guess leads to a phonetic hypothesis which computational search then checks across tablets. The multi-pronged strategy has been essential, given the script’s ambiguous nature. As one report noted, *“no single approach has cracked this script,”* but combining internal analysis with cultural context and comparative analogies is **“gradually illuminating Rongorongo’s content.”** Through this integrative approach, researchers have confidently identified glyphs for the **moon, chiefs, fish/victims, sand, cave, child, bird,** etc., and parsed out sequences as **calendars, genealogies, and voyages** – achievements that seemed unthinkable a few decades ago.

## Differing Interpretations and Remaining Ambiguities

Despite the advances, there are several areas where interpretations **diverge or uncertainty remains**. Rongorongo’s decipherment is a patchwork of high-confidence readings and more tentative hypotheses, and scholars sometimes disagree on what a glyph truly signifies. Key examples of such ambiguities include:

* **Glyph 76: “Copulation” Verb vs. “Lineage” Particle:** All experts agree glyph 76 links entities in a generative relationship, but is it read as an **action or a relational marker**? Fischer and Barthel saw 76’s phallic shape and took it as the verb *‘ai* (“to have intercourse”), effectively reading sequences as sentences (*X copulated with Y …*). By contrast, the earlier Russian decipherers treated 76 as a **patronymic** or genitive particle meaning “offspring of” (analogous to saying “X, son of Y”). Functionally these interpretations align – 76 indicates procreation or descent – but grammatically they differ in nuance. In fact, Rapa Nui usage might blur this distinction: a phrase like *ki ‘ai ki roto ki… ka pu te …* is a construction describing procreation resulting in offspring. Modern analysts recognize that **both views are “two sides of the same coin”**. The glyph could simultaneously imply the act (when a result follows) or simply mark lineage (between two names). The ambiguity shows the challenge in assigning a single part of speech to a glyph – it may not neatly map onto a modern word category. Most now describe 76 with a broad gloss like “relational linchpin of procreation/descent”. Still, context is key: on the Staff where outcomes (Z) are often given, 76 behaves like a verb (“beget”); in abbreviated king lists, it’s more like a connector (“son of”). This interpretational flexibility is accepted, not fully resolved, but not a hindrance – essentially both interpretations are considered valid in their contexts.

* **Content of the Santiago Staff:** There is an ongoing debate about **what narrative the Great Staff (Text I) actually encodes**. Fischer’s headline-grabbing claim was that it is a **cosmogonic creation chant** – essentially dozens of verses of gods, animals, etc. copulating and giving birth to elements of the world. He connected it to Polynesian creation myths, even citing a (mis-transcribed) line about land and fish producing the sun. However, critics like Pozdniakov and others pointed out inconsistencies: many Staff segments don’t fit the neat 3-glyph formula, and Fischer’s ad hoc switching of glyph meanings (fish as literal fish in one place, but as “womb” in another, etc.) seemed forced. An alternative interpretation sees the Staff as more of a **genealogical or historical list** – perhaps a memoriam of tribal ancestors or war casualties. The evidence for this is that one can parse some sections as “Person A 76 Person B 700” = “A, child of B, (is) dead” with glyph 700 marking death. Indeed, Rapa Nui elders spoke of *kohau ika* (“lines of fish”) meaning **lists of slain warriors**. If the Staff were such a list, it would align with oral categories. The high frequency of 76 could just mean it’s listing **lineages or pedigrees** (not necessarily divine couplings). Notably, Fischer’s own translation of one Staff sequence yielded fantastical imagery (birds mating with fish) that **has no clear parallel in Rapa Nui mythology** – a red flag for many. As of 2025, the Staff’s exact story remains **unconfirmed**: it’s agreed to be formulaic and likely genealogical or cosmogonic in nature, but whether it’s primarily mythological (as Fischer insisted) or more historical/memorial (as others lean) is unresolved. Future decipherment may show it combines both (mythic genealogy of tribes tracing back to gods). This debate exemplifies how the *same textual pattern* can be given different narrative spins. It underscores the need for caution – a proposed translation must hold across all sections and ideally across tablets, otherwise it might be reading too much into the symbols.

* **Extent of Phonetic Encoding:** There is lingering uncertainty about **how much of Rongorongo is phonetically encoded** (true writing) versus how much is semasiographic (conceptual). Some researchers argue that if it were largely phonetic, we would have detected consistent syllable patterns by now; the failure of any one phonetic “alphabet” to unlock it suggests a more **mnemonic, non-fully-phonetic system**. The script’s statistical profile doesn’t match typical phonetic texts (for example, no glyph dominates as a vowel would, and certain expected grammatical particles are missing). This has led many to view Rongorongo as a **proto-writing**: not encoding speech verbatim but encoding ideas that a knowledgeable reciter would expand upon. On the other hand, the partial decipherments (calendar nights, possibly some names) hint that the creators did at least sometimes represent specific words or sounds, even if abbreviated. It’s possible Rongorongo started as non-phonetic and evolved to include phonetic clues. Today, scholars continue to debate this, which affects decipherment strategy: a “phonetic camp” (minority) searches for consistent syllable values, while a “semantic camp” treats it more like a code only crackable via context. The truth may lie in between – a **multi-layered script** where glyphs convey meaning directly *and* occasionally represent sounds (for puns, names, grammatical cues). Until more is resolved, any attempt to assign a full **reading** (e.g. trying to pronounce entire sentences) remains highly speculative. The lack of clarity on this fundamental point – is it a language transcription or a symbolic aide-mémoire? – is itself a major ambiguity that frames all other interpretation differences.

* **Identification of Specific Names and Events:** While broad content (like “this is a genealogy” or “this is the moon calendar”) can be discerned, pinning down **exact referents** (like *which* individual or *which* place is meant by a glyph) is often unresolved. For example, tablet B’s voyage story seems evident, but scholars still discuss whether certain place glyphs correspond to specific toponyms (Poike vs. Maunga Pua, etc.). The “sand glyph” is clearly Anakena, but a nearby **dune area called Taharoa** could also be implied. The text is condensed, so a single glyph might stand for an entire place name or concept that is obvious only if you know the story. Similarly, we suspect some repeated name sequences on other tablets might correspond to actual historic king names – but without a direct bilingual, we can’t be sure if a given glyph sequence is, say, “Tuu Ko Iho” (a legendary chief) or something more generic. As a case in point, Nikolai Butinov believed one repetitive sequence on the Santiago Staff corresponded to the name **“Tiki Hati”**, based on a pattern he thought matched a known name in traditions. But this hasn’t been verified and could be coincidence. Thus, **personal names and proper nouns** are one of the murkiest aspects – the script likely encodes them, but we have not cracked their phonetic values yet. Until we do, a decipherment cannot specify “King so-and-so” with confidence, only “a chief’s name here”. This is a remaining gap between recognizing structure and truly reading content.

* **Untranslated Tablets and Segments:** A number of Rongorongo texts still **resist interpretation** or haven’t been studied as intensively. For instance, the *Keiti tablet (Text E)* was one Jaussen and Metoro attempted to “read,” but the chant Metoro provided (and Thomson recorded) turned out garbled and not clearly aligned with the glyphs. To date, Text E’s content is unknown – it shows no obvious calendar or the exact triadic formulas seen elsewhere. It might share phrases with other tablets, but those links remain to be mapped. The *Tahua tablet (Text A)*, one of the largest, also has no generally accepted decipherment beyond some speculation. There was a report that a sequence on Tahua involving **four vertical strokes** might indicate a number (possibly the **“four”** in a phrase about sending scouts), hinting that Tahua could contain a dispatch of explorers. If true, that could parallel the story on Aruku Kurenga (which mentions **seven** scouts). However, this is speculative and shows how scholars are testing numeric or **quantitative notations** in the script – another aspect not firmly decoded (except for the lunar count). In general, except for Mamari, Aruku, the Staff, and Small Santiago, many texts (like tablet *Q*, *P*, the two small reimiro pendants, etc.) remain largely mysterious. They likely hold similar types of content (prayers, genealogies, lists), but we haven’t pinpointed their themes. Some may contain **unique content** (e.g. a navigational guide or an agricultural calendar) that will require new keys to unlock. This uneven progress – deep understanding of a few sections versus almost none of others – is a reminder of how much work remains. Each tablet could have its own “genre” and decoding one doesn’t automatically decode another. Future efforts are focusing on systematically scanning these lesser-known texts for any of the known **patterns or glyph clusters** (for example, does tablet X contain the moon calendar sequence? Does tablet Y show the 200–76 genealogy pattern?). Wherever a match is found, that portion can be tentatively read using the established key; where no known pattern appears, we must apply educated guesses from context and keep searching for clues.

In summary, **what has been established vs. what remains unresolved** can be framed thus: We have established the broad *functions* of many glyphs (moon, person, fish, etc.) and *structures* of texts (calendrical, genealogical, mythic). We can confidently interpret certain sequences as meaning “this is a list of ancestors” or “this describes a voyage”. However, we often cannot read the *exact detail* – the personal names, the specific verbs, or the full syntax connecting those glyphs into fluent sentences. The script’s inherent ambiguity (conceptual vs phonetic) leaves multiple readings open for debate, like the nature of glyph 76 or the story behind the Staff. Scholars have a workable **consensus lexicon** of key glyph meanings, but many entries carry caveats (“possibly”, “context-dependent”). The *ambiguities* primarily concern how to interpret glyphs in different contexts (functional word vs literal picture, generic meaning vs specific name) and how to weave those glyph interpretations into a coherent translation without forcing the data. These are precisely the puzzles that ongoing research is targeting.

## Progress by Key Texts and Contributions to Decipherment

The Rongorongo corpus is small, but certain **key texts** have been instrumental in advancing decipherment. Each major artifact contributed clues and confirmed hypotheses, gradually building a composite understanding. Below we trace the progress across the main texts mentioned, highlighting how each one has aided the decipherment effort:

### Mamari Tablet (Text C) – *Lunar Calendar and Beyond*

The Mamari tablet is pivotal as it contains the **only fully explained passage** so far: the lunisolar calendar sequence. Barthel’s identification of \~30 glyphs corresponding to the nights of the month (including two “leap nights”) was a landmark. It proved that **Rongorongo could encode systematic knowledge** (astronomy/calendrics), not just vague ritual. By matching Mamari’s repeating crescents and unique moon glyph to known Rapa Nui month-night names, researchers locked in several glyph meanings (crescent = *rā* or night, glyph 152 = full moon “Omotohi”). This decipherment served as a **Rosetta Stone fragment** for methodology – it taught researchers how to align glyph patterns with external data. Importantly, **Mamari shows a mix of content**: after the calendar (which appears on one side of the tablet), the rest seems to be narrative or genealogical text. Analysts applying the multi-method approach to Mamari’s other lines found repeated sequences akin to the 76-based formulas (albeit fewer than on the Staff). By using the updated glyph lexicon and Rapa Nui chants, they suspect Mamari’s non-calendar portion encodes a **cosmogonic genealogy** (perhaps verses of creation similar to Atua Matariri). For example, Mamari contains glyph 76 in contexts implying “X begat Y” relationships and shares some sequences with the Staff and Aruku Kurenga. One hypothesis is that Mamari might outline a **creation story or royal lineage** in a condensed form, acting almost like a **compendium** of knowledge: part calendar, part myth/genealogy. The presence of the calendar next to a narrative hints that rongorongo tablets could compile different genres of information on one artifact. Mamari’s calendar also helped calibrate reading order and glyph orientation (since the phases must run in chronological order, resolving some ambiguities in how to physically read the tablet). In summary, **Mamari contributed the first decipherment (calendar)** and continues to guide interpretation of other texts. It confirmed certain glyph values with near-certainty (moon, full moon, etc.) and demonstrated that **cultural context (calendar and myth) is essential** to decode the script. Every serious decipherment attempt now uses Mamari as a testing ground – if a theory can’t explain Mamari’s clear sections, it’s likely flawed. Thus Mamari remains a cornerstone, both as a partially read text and as a model for decipherment technique.

### Aruku Kurenga (Text B) – *Migration Legend Decoded*

Aruku Kurenga has recently emerged as a **decipherment success story**, thanks to its repetitive triple structure. It contains three parallel sequences separated by a known section delimiter glyph. Researchers long suspected it might be a genealogical list or narrative told in three parts, but only by correlating it with Rapa Nui’s foundational myth of discovery did the pieces fall into place. The breakthrough was recognizing that **all three sequences share the same series of place glyphs** in the same order. This strongly suggested a *fixed geography or itinerary* was being repeated – a clue that the text might recount multiple voyages following the same route. Rapa Nui oral tradition indeed says the island was discovered via **three voyages**: (1) the visionary journey of Hau-Maka, (2) the expedition of seven scouts, (3) the migration led by King Hotu Matuʻa. By labeling the three sequences A, B, C and comparing to the legend, it became clear that each sequence likely corresponds to one voyage, with only the **leader glyph and a few context glyphs** differing: sequence A begins with a glyph interpreted as Hau-Maka (perhaps a spiritual figure or his name pun), sequence B begins with glyph 7 (the *poki* “offspring” symbol for the youths), and sequence C begins with glyph 200 (the *ariki* “chief” symbol for Hotu Matuʻa). All three then list coastal landmarks (small islands, headlands, bays) in order, ending with the **“sand” glyph (9)** for Anakena beach. This was a eureka moment: Tablet B was essentially a **written map of the legend**, each sequence a stanza about a voyage. The few unique glyphs in each sequence further confirm this reading: the second sequence (scouts) uniquely contains the **cave/tomb glyph (13)** marking the death of one scout, exactly as the story goes. The third sequence adds a **star-like glyph (possibly glyph 8)** that might indicate an auspicious star or timing for the king’s voyage – Rapa Nui lore often mentions navigating by stars, and including a star sign in the king’s chapter would be appropriate. These identifications of glyph 13 as “tomb”, glyph 8 as likely a celestial marker, etc., all flowed from aligning the text with the narrative. With this key, scholars could **“read” Aruku Kurenga in broad strokes**: the tablet “says” – *Hau-Maka’s journey around the island, finding the sandy beach; then the scouts’ journey (the youths) retracing the route, burying their companion; then the chief’s voyage following the same path to Anakena*. Notably, Tablet B confirmed several glyph meanings that had been hypothesized: the **ariki glyph 200** was indeed used to denote a chief leading the third sequence, glyph 7 (*poki*) functioned in context as “young descendants” (the scout party), and glyph 9 (sand) clearly signified the destination Anakena. These give us high confidence in those interpretations. Aruku Kurenga’s decipherment is significant not just for reading that tablet, but for what it **implies about other texts**: it shows that a rongorongo text can encode a *sequential narrative with a beginning, middle, end*, using repetition and sectioning to parallel an oral chant format. It confirms that the script can handle **storyline and chronology** (not just static lists), albeit in a very formulaic way. This tablet’s analysis also showcased the effectiveness of combining methods: only by using **mythology, lexicon clues, and structural analysis together** was the full picture realized. Now that Aruku Kurenga is essentially “cracked” in terms of general content, it provides a template to examine other tablets for similar multi-part narratives or to spot the same place-name glyphs elsewhere (e.g. does any other text mention the “sand” glyph, possibly referencing Anakena or a metaphorical landfall?). In sum, **Aruku Kurenga contributed a major decipherment coup** – the likely decoding of the island’s settlement legend – and in doing so, it reinforced the meanings of a suite of glyphs and demonstrated how deeply Rongorongo is tied to known Rapa Nui history and myth.

### Great Santiago Staff (Text I) – *Procreative Formula and Debated Readings*

The Great Staff is the longest inscription and was central to many decipherment attempts. Its very length (over 2,300 glyphs) meant any pattern would be statistically apparent, and indeed the Staff revealed the **triadic sequence with glyph 76** repeated hundreds of times. This made it clear that the text is highly structured – likely a litany or genealogy as opposed to free narrative. The Staff also has distinctive **section dividers** (vertical strokes, Barthel’s glyph 326 or ᶿ, also referenced as glyph 32) that break it into \~100 segments. This feature, unique to the Staff, signaled that it’s formatted like verses or entries in a list. The Staff’s analysis has been a tale of two interpretations: Fischer’s *creation chant* vs. the *genealogical list*. Fischer’s work on the Staff in the 1990s put Rongorongo on the map; he asserted the whole corpus (especially the Staff) was composed of **cosmogonic “begat” sequences** and he provided a provocative translation of one segment. His example, “All the birds copulated with the fish; there issued forth the sun,” gave the first tantalizing glimpse of a possible reading of Rongorongo in plain language (albeit mythic language). This was a dramatic moment – it suggested the code could be cracked and yielded a coherent (if bizarre) sentence. Fischer identified certain glyphs on the Staff with specific Rapanui words (e.g. 606 as “all the birds”, 76 as “mated with”, 700 as “fish”, 8 as “sun”), and linked the repetitive structure to the Atua Matariri chant format. However, as discussed, other experts remain **unconvinced** by many of Fischer’s finer points. The Staff has thus been a lesson in scholarly caution: it provides *enough data to support multiple readings*. The alternative view (Staff as genealogical or memorial list) gained traction because of how glyph 700 (fish) could serve as a death marker and how a “name 76 name 700” pattern fits a known genre (war dead list). Indeed, some 19th-century Rapanui reportedly called the Staff text a “list of **ika** (victims)” which aligns with that interpretation. At present, the Staff is partially deciphered to the extent that **we recognize its structure and many of its glyphs’ general meaning** – e.g. we know glyph 76 is linking names, glyph 700 likely terminates segments (with a meaning like “died” or end of a generation), glyph 606 is some collective noun (birds or clans), etc.. We can segment the text: “something *76* something *700* | something *76* something *700* | …” over and over. What we lack is agreement on the *overall narrative*: is it mythological genealogy (perhaps the lineage of gods or symbolic ancestors) or human genealogy (chiefs and their fates)? It could even be both (mythic ancestors presented as a genealogy). The Staff’s contribution to decipherment, therefore, is a bit paradoxical: it *confirmed* the importance of glyph 76 and repetitive formulas, and gave impetus to the phonetic-rebus approach (through Fischer’s attempt), but it also illustrated the *dangers of over-interpretation*. The Staff taught researchers that any proposed translation must be internally consistent and culturally plausible. It also highlighted the need for cross-text validation: Fischer’s reading stumbled when applied to other texts (e.g. it made nonsense of the Small Santiago genealogy). Thus, the Staff remains somewhat enigmatic. Nonetheless, it has anchored key ideas: (1) **Rongorongo is not narrative prose but a series of formulaic lines**, (2) glyph 76 is central as a structural element, and (3) content-wise, it deals with fundamental matters of lineage, life, and possibly creation or death. The Staff is so central that any comprehensive decipherment theory must “work” on the Staff. It continues to be at the forefront of research, with scholars re-examining high-res tracings to see if subtle variations in those repeated sequences hold additional clues (for instance, noting if certain glyphs only appear in certain sections could hint at semantic shifts). In short, the **Great Staff’s legacy in decipherment** is proving that Rongorongo had grammar-like structure and inspiring bold hypotheses, even if it has not yet yielded a consensus translation of its story.

### Small Santiago Tablet (Text G) – *Genealogical Key Insight*

The Small Santiago tablet (G) may be physically small, but it delivered an outsized insight: the possibility of **genealogical text**. In 1957, Butinov and Knorozov’s analysis of a sequence on tablet G (lines Gv5–Gv6) was arguably the first time anyone read a Rongorongo passage with some understanding of its function. They noticed a person-like glyph alternating with another glyph (which we now know as 76) in a chain, which led them to posit “name – son of name – son of name…”. This hypothesis identified glyph 200 (the person glyph in question) as likely a **title or personal name indicator** (they thought maybe it was a specific king’s name repeated, but later consensus leans to it meaning *ariki*, a title). More crucially, it introduced the idea that Rongorongo could record **royal succession or genealogical lines**. This was a turning point: prior to that, some had doubted if the script had any linguistic order at all, but the G tablet pattern was strongly suggestive of syntax (repeated use of a connector sign at regular intervals). It also matched an oral tradition concept (*kōhau ta‘u* “lines of years” – year-annals or king lists) which gave it cultural resonance. The Small Santiago tablet’s pattern helped validate the **phonetic-rebus decipherment approach** because if indeed 76 meant “of” or a similar genitive, it implied the script wasn’t just symbolic but could denote grammatical relationships (even if implicitly). This find also cast new light on the **Great Staff**: once G indicated a genealogy, researchers looked back at the Staff’s multitude of 76s and considered that it too could be lineage-based. In effect, G’s discovery planted the seed for the later reinterpretation of the Staff as possibly a list of names (versus Fischer’s creation myth). Today, the Small Santiago tablet’s genealogy interpretation is widely accepted (often cited as a rare point of agreement in Rongorongo studies). However, one must note it’s *structurally* deciphered – we know what it likely represents, but not the actual names in the sequence. Some have tried to match the count of segments in G’s list to the known number of ancient kings to see if it could be the **royal lineage of Rapa Nui**, but without identifiable names that remains speculative. Nonetheless, tablet G gave the decipherment effort a **proof of concept**: by identifying a plausible “sentence” pattern in Rongorongo, it proved the script carries structured content that can be logically parsed. Every subsequent serious researcher (Guy, Fischer, Pozdniakov, etc.) cited the Butinov & Knorozov finding as foundational. In summary, **Tablet G contributed the genealogical key** – confirming glyph 76’s function and supporting the notion that Rongorongo recorded genealogies/lists. It remains a reference point, and any new lexicon includes the entry for glyph 76 partly thanks to tablet G’s initial clue. It’s a case where a small fragment unlocked a big concept.

### Tablet Keiti (Text E) – *Unresolved and Cautionary Tale*

Tablet E (Keiti) was one of the pieces Bishop Jaussen had Metoro Taua Ure “read” in the 1860s. Unfortunately, Metoro’s chants for Keiti (and others) were inconsistent and likely not genuine readings. Métraux later showed that these recitations devolved into gibberish, meaning we cannot rely on them as translations. Thus, Keiti stands as a largely undeciphered text to this day. It contains some repeated motifs, and Barthel noted a *lunar crescent-like sequence* in Keiti’s lines that might be related to calendrical information, but it’s not as clear-cut as Mamari’s calendar. One line of Keiti has drawn attention: Barthel’s text E includes a **sequence of glyphs that repeats** in a pattern, which Fischer once tentatively read as *“rongorongo”* (the Rapanui word meaning “to recite”) – essentially he thought the tablet might self-reference the act of chanting. This interpretation was extremely conjectural and not substantiated by others. What Keiti has done is remind researchers to be careful: Metoro had given many glyphs odd names when “reading” Keiti (like calling one glyph *mahiro*, a kind of fish, and another *porcelain* which was a misunderstanding). These were mostly deemed red herrings. Modern work on Keiti involves scanning it for any of the familiar sequences. Pozdniakov’s database of repeating phrases shows a few short sequences in Keiti that also appear on tablets B or C, suggesting it might share content with those (for instance, a short genealogy snippet or a ritual refrain). But nothing as long as the calendar or the migration story has been isolated in Keiti. Some have hypothesized that Keiti could be a **mix of genres** like Mamari – perhaps containing a less obvious calendar or a prayer. Without a clear “hook” like a known sequence, Keiti remains an open puzzle. It has thus far *contributed to decipherment mainly by process of elimination*: by comparing Keiti’s glyph frequency and patterns to others, researchers have gleaned that it doesn’t contain the simple lunar list (too few crescents in a row), and it doesn’t obviously contain the procreation formula in abundance like the Staff (fewer 76s relatively). This suggests Keiti might be a different type of text, possibly a ritual chant or invocation. That guides how we approach it – looking for other structural clues (maybe repetition of a ceremonial phrase, etc.). In essence, **Keiti’s current status** highlights how much of Rongorongo is still unknown and that some tablets will likely only yield to decipherment after we crack more common references on the easier tablets. It also underscores the partial and sometimes misleading nature of early attempts (Metoro’s readings), cautioning us to rely on solid evidence over 19th-century “glossaries” which have proven problematic.

### Tahua Tablet (Text A) – *Largest Tablet, Minimal Decipherment*

Tahua is the other large tablet (along with Mamari) that Metoro attempted to interpret for Jaussen. It, too, did not yield any straightforward translation; Metoro’s recorded chant (if indeed it corresponded to Tahua) was one of those that become “clearly ridiculous towards the end”. Tahua has the distinction of containing a very lengthy text with many unique glyph combinations (Barthel’s tracing of text A is extensive). Yet ironically, because it doesn’t have an obvious repetitive segment like Mamari’s calendar or the Staff’s sections, it’s been harder to decode. One intriguing clue from Tahua mentioned in research is a **possible numeral or count**. As noted, a report alluded to a glyph of four vertical strokes on Tahua being read as the number 4 in context of “sending explorers”. If correct, that suggests Tahua might recount some event involving a number (perhaps the **“seven explorers”** legend variant, where a glyph for 7 might appear). This is speculative, but it points to researchers actively hunting Tahua’s text for any anchor – a number, a known name, anything. Tahua, being so long, likely contains multiple sections or lists. One guess is that Tahua might contain an **astronomical or calendrical list** as well, possibly the list of 13 months of the year or some eclipse cycle, given its length. Another guess is that it could be a **genealogy of kings** (if not covered elsewhere) or a chant of a different myth. So far, no consensus. Tahua has contributed to decipherment in a more indirect way: it was one of the tablets Jaussen published glyph drawings for, and Barthel included it in his corpus. It helped in the 20th-century to establish the **full inventory of glyphs**, as Tahua has variants not seen on other tablets. For example, some rare composite signs on Tahua taught epigraphers about allographs (alternate forms) – in comparing Tahua’s glyphs to others, it became evident that some signs that looked unique were actually combinations of simpler signs. This was part of Pozdniakov’s finding that only \~52 basic signs exist. Tahua likely contributed data to that reduction, by showing certain complex-looking glyphs could be broken into parts known from other tablets. In terms of content decipherment, however, **Tahua remains largely unresolved**. It’s a prime candidate for future analysis using the lexicon and any deciphered sequences from other texts. For instance, if one of Aruku Kurenga’s place-name sequences or the Mamari calendar snippet is hidden somewhere in Tahua, pattern-matching algorithms might eventually spot it. Until then, Tahua is a tantalizing blank in our understanding – the largest canvas of the script that we can’t yet read. Its presence reminds the decipherers not to declare victory too soon: even if Mamari, Aruku, and the Staff become well-understood, we’ll still need to decode texts like Tahua to claim a comprehensive decipherment.

*In summary,* each main text has played a role: Mamari gave us the **calendar and confirmed mythic iconography** (moon glyph, etc.), Aruku Kurenga provided a **narrative framework tied to legend**, the Staff illustrated the **formulaic/iterative style** (and provoked debates on interpretation), Small Santiago pointed out **genealogical structures**, Keiti and Tahua highlighted areas of **lingering mystery** (and the pitfalls of unreliable early “translations”). Together, they suggest that Rongorongo texts, while varied in topic, share a **common structural DNA**: they all use repetition, standard glyph combinations, and are rooted in **oral tradition content**. Decipherment progress often jumped when researchers realized connections *between* tablets – e.g. recognizing a phrase from Mamari reappears on another, or a glyph value from Aruku helps parse a line on Keiti. This cross-pollination accelerates as more texts are partially understood. We are reaching a point where we can start to see the **“big picture” of Rongorongo’s corpus**: it encodes chiefly genealogies, cosmological chants, historical migration stories, calendars, and possibly other knowledge (agricultural rituals, navigational lore) using a **consistent system of glyph-phrases and mnemonic cues**. Each tablet is like a chapter in the Rapa Nui knowledge archive, and deciphering each one illuminates a different facet of their culture.

## Links Between Glyphs and Rapa Nui Culture (Chants, Myths, Calendar)

From the outset, scholars suspected that cracking Rongorongo would require understanding **Rapa Nui’s oral culture**. This has proven true: virtually every glyph decipherment and text interpretation has involved linking the script to Rapa Nui language, chants, myths, or the lunar calendar. We can enumerate several important connections:

* **Lunar Calendar & Traditional Astronomy:** The identification of the Mamari calendar was only possible thanks to 19th-century ethnographic records of the Rapanui **month and night names**. Navy lieutenant William Thomson’s 1886 expedition recorded the names of the 12 (actually 13 in a cycle) months and the 28 nights of the month. Without this list, Barthel might not have recognized the pattern on Mamari. Once matched, the tablet even clarified an aspect of the oral record: Thomson’s informant described an extra month (and extra nights) which aligned with the **intercalary crescents** on Mamari. Thus the tablet confirmed that the Rapa Nui calendar was **luni-solar** and how they tracked extra nights – a fine detail of cultural astronomy preserved in glyphs. Specific glyphs were directly tied to mythic descriptions of the moon: for example, the full moon glyph 152 was understood via a mythic phrase about an old woman (cook) in the moon. Additionally, one glyph in the calendar sections appears to correspond to *Atua* (meaning “god/spirit” and also the name of the 11th night) and could depict something like a spirit or a special symbol, hinting that even ritual practices (perhaps moon ceremonies) are encoded. The calendar decipherment not only gave glyph meanings but showed that Rongorongo scribes were encoding practical and ceremonial timekeeping knowledge exactly as described in oral sources. This established that **oral knowledge (like month names)** was deliberately inscribed. It also means any future translator of Rongorongo will inevitably be mapping glyphs to culturally-specific terms (gods, ritual items, etc.) rather than generic ideas.

* **Genealogies and King Lists:** Polynesian cultures placed enormous importance on **genealogies** – oral chants could list dozens of generations of chiefs or gods. Easter Island was no exception; genealogical chants (ko hau hakairi, etc.) were part of the lore. The discovery that tablet G likely lists “King A son of B son of C…” fits perfectly with known tradition. The possible content of such a list could be the legendary kings of Rapa Nui (Hotu Matuʻa’s successors). In oral tradition, king lists were remembered well into the 19th century; for instance, missionary records mention a sequence of names of rulers. If scholars can align any portion of a Rongorongo genealogy with these remembered names, it would be a huge confirmation. One attempt has been to see if the number of names or order on the Small Santiago tablet corresponds to any king list versions (some accounts list about 57 rulers from Hotu Matuʻa onward – if G has around that number of entries, it’s enticing). However, differences in spelling and the fragmentary nature of data make this difficult. Still, the concept that **glyph 200 = ariki (chief)** was reinforced by the fact that it often appears at segment starts or in contexts consistent with where a name of a person should be. Also, the Rapanui word *ariki* (chief/king) was known, so matching a glyph to that concept was feasible. The chants that Thomson collected in 1886 included one called *“Eaha to rā nā ariki Kete”* (translatable as “Where are the days of King Kete?” – possibly a lament of a king). Some have speculated if that chant’s content might align with a tablet text (maybe Keiti or another), but no direct match found yet. Nonetheless, elements from Thomson’s chants have helped; *Atua Matariri* was one, and another chant *Apai* (which enumerates food plants) could relate to some sequences of glyphs that appear botanical. For example, the word *poporo* (a plant) appears in Atua Matariri; if we suspect a glyph is that plant (maybe a particular flower glyph), we can check if that glyph shows up in sequences that look like the structure “X 76 Y ⇒ Z” in the Staff or Mamari. This cross-checking is ongoing. In essence, **Rongorongo glyphs serve as mnemonics for genealogical and mythic content**, so knowing the content from oral sources is key to guessing the glyph meaning. The identification of glyph 76 as a relational “begat/son of” marker was directly bolstered by the formulaic phrasing in creation chants (the *ki ‘ai ki roto* structure) which explicitly uses a verb for procreation. Without knowing those chants, one might have thought 76 could mean something else like “and” or just a decorative separator, but the chants strongly suggested it had a sexual or lineage connotation.

* **Mythology and Legendary Figures:** Many glyphs likely depict characters or beings from Rapa Nui mythology. For instance, glyph 380 (a bird-headed human figure) is commonly thought to represent **Makemake**, the chief god associated with fertility and the birdman cult. Makemake was often depicted with a bird-like face in petroglyphs; seeing a similar motif in Rongorongo implies the scribes included religious iconography. If glyph 380 is Makemake, then segments containing it could be referencing the god or related myths (Makemake is tied to creation in some accounts). Another example: glyph 21 (Barthel’s numbering) is a glyph that looks like a seated figure with a ring – some have likened it to a **turtle** or a **lizard** figure. In Rapa Nui myth, a lizard (mo‘o) appears in certain tales. It’s possible some glyphs correspond to clan totems or mythic beings (like the lizard, or certain bird species central to myths). The Aruku Kurenga decipherment directly linked glyphs to mythical characters: “A” leader glyph presumably is Hau-Maka (though we can’t pronounce it, we know it stands for that character). Metoro’s 19th-c. readings, despite their issues, occasionally align with mythic names: for instance, he mentioned **“Kuukuu”** upon seeing the cave glyph – Kuukuu is indeed the name of the scout who died. That means Metoro recognized the story from the glyph sequence and supplied the name from memory, confirming the narrative context (even if he wasn’t “reading” the name phonetically). This is a profound example of how Rongorongo functioned: the glyph gave a *clue* (“tomb”), and the knowledgeable chanter (Metoro) filled in the actual plot detail (“Ah, Kuukuu’s burial”). It shows that *the tablets and the oral myths were intrinsically linked*. We also see use of **metaphor and metonymy** exactly as in oral lore. The “sand” glyph doesn’t name Anakena outright, but sand is a metonym for that place. The “bird” glyph at the sequence end doesn’t say “Anakena”, but alludes to it via meaning (“bird cave”). This is analogous to poetic devices in chants where indirect references are used for sacred places or people. Another interesting cultural link is the concept of **“ika” (fish) for victims**: Easter Islanders called slain enemies “fish” in metaphor, and sure enough, Rongorongo uses the fish glyph where it appears lists of dead or outcomes of battles might be. It even matches the term *kōhau ika* for war records. Such correspondences anchor the script firmly in known linguistic and cultural practice.

* **Chants and Poetry:** The structural analysis reveals that Rongorongo texts were likely written versions of **chants (haka)**, many of which had a cyclic or refrain-based form. Jacques Guy and others pointed out that repeated sequences in the tablets resemble *pauses* or refrains in Polynesian chants. For example, if a certain invocation or honoring line was repeated after each stanza in a prayer, it might show up as a repeated glyph cluster across a tablet. There are hints of this: aside from the obvious repeats like the Staff’s copulation formula, there may be more subtle refrains. Some tablets have **parallelism** (two successive lines sharing structure) which is a known feature of Polynesian oral oratory. One candidate is the *Berlin Tablet O*, which apparently has a couple of lines with repeated phrases that could be a refrain or couplet. If identified, these could correspond to something like a repeated blessing or chorus that was known in chants. Without direct oral records of these specific chants, researchers try to reconstruct them by reading the glyph patterns. It’s somewhat reverse-engineering a lost chant from the notation. In doing so, they rely on general Polynesian poetic conventions: alliteration, balanced phrases, use of certain stock epithets. For instance, many Polynesian chants begin lines with words like *tū*, *ka*, *ra* as grammatical markers. In Rongorongo, we don’t see obvious phonetic particles, but we see possibly a **herald glyph** that starts sections (like a **special variant of glyph 62 or 606** on the Staff, which Fischer thought could mean “all” or a collective to start each myth line). It might be that each line begins with a word like “Thus…” or “Behold…” that is encoded by a particular glyph as a sort of **section-starter**. Such features are still being investigated.

The upshot is that **Rongorongo cannot be deciphered in isolation from Rapa Nui’s language and lore**. The decipherment project has essentially become an interdisciplinary synthesis of linguistics, anthropology, and astronomy. We see every decipherment is validated by cultural fit: the calendar sequence matched real month names; the genealogy pattern matched how Rapanui described lineage; the migration story on Aruku matched the island’s origin myth in detail. When Fischer’s interpretation overstepped what is attested in myth (e.g. birds mating with fish), it was called into question because it lacked a clear cultural parallel. The Rongorongo signs themselves often *embody* cultural concepts: e.g. the **turtle glyph** likely ties to the sea and perhaps the **Tangata Manu (birdman) ritual** often involved carving turtle images; the **canoe-like glyph** (Barthel #60) almost certainly means “canoe/voyage” in contexts where travel is described. In fact, in Aruku sequences, a glyph shaped a bit like a canoe appears when describing crossing the sea or moving along the coast – likely a direct symbol for journey. These interpretations come straight from understanding Rapa Nui life (canoes were vital, the only way to travel from Hiva).

Even the **decision to develop Rongorongo** in the first place likely sprang from the cultural need to preserve complex genealogies, chants, and calendrical knowledge in a portable format as the society became more complex. Oral tradition was strong, but Rongorongo may have been an extra tool to aid memory for priests – essentially carving the core “indexes” of chants onto wood. In the late 19th century, the last chant experts could still (briefly) use the glyphs as prompts – Metoro’s case showed that he would look at a glyph and launch into a chant segment, even if he wasn’t literally decoding each sign. That is exactly how a mnemonic script would function: glyphs link to **chants, myths, or lists that existed independently in the culture**. The decipherment process has essentially been about **reconstructing those links**. As more glyphs get tentatively matched to Rapanui words (via rebus) or figures (via myth), our Rongorongo “dictionary” grows, and in turn that allows reading longer segments by making educated guesses. It’s a virtuous cycle of cross-reference.

To illustrate, once glyph 9 was identified as “sand/Anakena” from Aruku and Metoro’s hint, researchers checked other tablets for glyph 9. It turns out glyph 9 appears in a few other inscriptions, often at the end of sequences or next to a “water” glyph, possibly referencing landfalls or beaches in other contexts. It may be that other migration or travel-related texts also mention arriving at land (sand). This cultural motif – the importance of finding a beach to land canoes – is a unique Rapa Nui concern (since Anakena was the sole beach). Thus, by knowing that motif, one can seek similar narrative in another text. Indeed, if Tablet A or E contains another myth (perhaps the story of a later migration or inter-clan war where someone lands at a beach), glyph 9 would again show up. In this way, cultural knowledge guides where to look for particular glyphs and sequences.

In conclusion of this section, the **glyph–culture links** have been fundamental: *without Rapa Nui chants, myths, vocabulary, and ethnography, we would have almost nothing deciphered.* Conversely, what has been deciphered has often enriched our understanding of Rapa Nui culture itself. We now realize the tablets likely encode a **repository of knowledge** – from the scientific (the calendar) to the historical (the king lists, migration story) to the spiritual (creation chants, genealogies of gods). This mirrors the content of oral tradition. The decipherment project thus is not only cracking a script but also piecing together fragments of Easter Island’s heritage. It’s a beautiful synergy: the culture explains the script, and the script in turn corroborates and details the culture.

## Comparative Scripts and Iconographic Parallels

Although Rongorongo appears to be a unique invention with no direct relation to other writing systems, scholars have drawn on analogies from other scripts to better understand its structure and devise strategies. These comparative insights help frame Rongorongo’s place in the world’s writing systems and highlight both similarities and differences:

* **Independent Invention Parallels:** Only a handful of times in history did writing emerge independently (Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Mesoamerica – and possibly Rapa Nui, if we consider it writing). In these cases, we see **pictographs gradually gaining phonetic meaning**. For example, early **Sumerian cuneiform** began as drawings of objects (a star for “sky”, a bowl for “food”) and later these signs were also used for their sounds (the bowl sign could represent the syllable “DU” if that was the word for food). Rongorongo seems to be at an intermediate stage of this evolution: its glyphs are clearly pictorial and convey meaning directly (semantic), but there is evidence some were chosen for the sounds of the depicted word (phonetic). This is analogous to what happened in **Egyptian hieroglyphs**, where a symbol of a bee could mean the concept “king” because the Egyptian word for bee (*bit*) sounded like part of the word for king (*nsw-bit*, “king of Lower Egypt”). In Rongorongo, a fish glyph meaning “victim” is a similar acrophonic pun: *ika* = fish = war casualty. A **bird glyph** possibly stands for the god Makemake not just because Makemake is depicted as a bird-man, but also *make* means bird in Rapanui (so the word itself is embedded). Scholars explicitly note that **Rongorongo exploited wordplay**, likely using the same rebus principles as Proto-Egyptian or Proto-Sinaitic scripts. For instance, Proto-Sinaitic turned an ox head pictogram into the letter A (from *‘alp*, “ox”). If Rapa Nui had done something similar, a glyph of (say) a turtle (*honue*) might stand for the sound *ho* or *u* if those were meaningful. We haven’t definitively cracked a pure phonetic letter in Rongorongo (like an alphabetic letter), but the idea of using the first sounds of a word represented by a glyph is plausible. Comparative study encourages us to look for repeated glyph pairs that might correspond to repeated syllables or rhyming sequences in known Rapa Nui poetry. So far, we’ve had more success with whole-word rebuses than with individual syllables, but the principle is the same.

* **Structural Markers and Determinatives:** Many scripts use non-phonetic signs as grammatical or category markers (e.g. determinatives in Egyptian, classifiers in Sumerian). Rongorongo appears to have analogous devices. For example, Egyptian would put a symbol of a god after writing a god’s name – Rongorongo similarly might prefix a deity or important name with a certain glyph (perhaps glyph 200 *ariki* for any high-status name). The repeated **leader glyphs A, B, C** at the start of Aruku Kurenga’s sequences function like determinatives indicating the subject of that section (Hau-Maka vs scouts vs chief). The **section divider** glyph (32) on the Staff is akin to a punctuation mark or a paragraph break symbol – something also seen in other scripts (Maya had glyphs to mark sentence ends, for example). These structural signs show up because writing a purely continuous text would be too ambiguous; the scribes inserted these markers to chunk information, much as others did. Recognizing this, researchers looked to other scripts for possible equivalents. One idea is that glyph 76 itself may act somewhat like a **grammatical particle** akin to a genitive or verb connector – which in languages like Sumerian or Akkadian often have dedicated signs or affixes. But here it’s pictorial. Another structural element is the potential **plural marker** (the mention of a “hand” element indicating plural in the scouts sequence). Many scripts have a special sign or modification for plural (Egyptian added three strokes to pluralize a noun). In Rapa Nui’s case, Fischer posited a hand shape on the bird glyph made it plural “birds”. While his specific linguistic justification was shaky (borrowing Tahitian *mau*), the general concept of adding something to denote plural is very much in line with known scripts. We have since seen plausible evidence of plural: e.g. glyph 606 might literally be a doubled bird sign to mean plural *manu*. Comparative studies remind us to look for such patterns – doubling or tripling signs often means plural or intensity in other hieroglyphic scripts. Indeed, the notion of **ligatures** (combining two signs into one) is a common feature in ancient writing (e.g. combining two cuneiform signs to make a compound word). Rongorongo exhibits ligatures as well: analysts have noted cases where what Barthel thought was a single glyph is actually two glyphs fused (like a human figure with a smaller figure attached could be glyph X + glyph Y together). By comparing sequences, they find the same two components separated in one context and joined in another. This method – borrowed from decipherments of other scripts where parallel texts revealed allographs – was applied to Rongorongo successfully due to the **repetitive sequences on Aruku Kurenga**. For example, if “Anakena” is represented by bird+sand in one sequence but by a single combined glyph in another, aligning those sequences shows that one glyph is a merger of the two. This technique of comparing repeats to identify allographs is exactly how scholars cracked varying writings of names in Egyptian and Maya. So, Rongorongo, though isolated, has been tackled with the toolkit developed from other decipherments.

* **Iconographic Motifs:** On a purely visual level, some Rongorongo symbols bear intriguing resemblance to symbols in other scripts, but usually at the level of basic human symbolism, not as a sign of historical contact. For instance, a **crescent moon** shape is found among Near Eastern pictographic inscriptions as well, simply because the crescent is universally recognized as “moon” – and indeed it meant “month” or “night” in Sumerian too. Rongorongo’s crescent (glyph \~10) meaning “night” is a convergence of iconography with those ancient systems, reinforcing that the logic of pictography is often cross-cultural. Similarly, the concept of using a **fish** to denote not just a fish but also “food” or “victim” is not unique; in Egyptian, a fish hieroglyph can be part of words meaning abundance, etc., and in Chinese oracle bone script, a fish can mean surplus/abundance by pun. These parallels tell us that the Rongorongo inventors were tapping into the same human cognitive strategies that others did – use **concrete images to represent related or abstract concepts** (fish → victim, bird → offspring flying away maybe, etc.). Another motif: the **anthropomorphic figure with a large round head** (we identified as full moon glyph 152). Interestingly, other cultures also personified the moon as a figure. While there’s no direct link, it’s a coincidental parallel that affirms the reading – when we see a round-headed being in Rongorongo and think “moon,” we find Polynesian myth backs it up, just as other cultures might depict a moon goddess.

* **No Foreign Borrowing:** Early on, some speculated Rongorongo might have been inspired by Spanish writing or other scripts, but radiocarbon dating disproved that (it pre-dates significant contact). Also, the signs are not alphabets or characters from any known script. For example, comparisons were made to **Indus Valley script** by a few fringe researchers due to superficial similarity of some shapes, but that’s considered coincidental and not taken seriously in academia. The shapes of Rongorongo letters are unique; even the **Glagolitic alphabet** (an Old Slavic script with curvilinear letters) shares no common forms, illustrating that Rongorongo’s creators invented shapes afresh just as Saints Cyril and Methodius did for Glagolitic in the 9th century. We mention Glagolitic because it’s a case of a consciously invented script that didn’t copy letter forms from Greek/Latin but made new ones – proving that humans can and do create novel writing symbols without direct borrowing. Rongorongo likely arose similarly independently, albeit evolving out of petroglyph art tradition rather than a single inventor.

* **Comparative Counting Systems:** Another angle is numbers – researchers wonder if those vertical stroke glyphs might indicate numbers like in other scripts (Egyptian used tick marks for 1,2,3). If tablet B indeed needed to indicate “seven” scouts, how would they do it? Possibly by seven short vertical lines or another convention. We know Easter Island used the lunar calendar (30 nights, organized in groups), but how did they record, say, the **number of months** or other counts? No obvious purely numeric sequences have been decoded, but the search is informed by comparisons: e.g. **Mayans** wrote dates with bars and dots, Egyptians repeated strokes. In Rongorongo, the “comb-like glyph” that appears in Mamari’s calendar might actually be a visual count of nights (some glyphs have multiple short strokes that could be tallies). If we identify a numeric, that could allow us to read quantities in other texts (like “7 young men” on Aruku Kurenga if seven can be shown). Comparative knowledge tells us if the culture needed to record a number symbolically, they’d likely do it by repetition or a standard symbol (like “V” shape for 5 as in tally marks). So far, aside from the possible four-lines = 4, this remains unsolved.

In essence, **comparative script analysis has not provided a direct key (since Rongorongo is sui generis), but it has provided a conceptual playbook**. It reassures researchers that what they see – mixture of logographic and phonetic, heavy abbreviation, repeated formulas – has analogues in known scripts at certain stages of development. For example, Linear B (Mycenaean Greek syllabary) needed context to read due to omitted vowels and ideograms; similarly Rongorongo likely omits grammatical filler and relies on context. Or like how early Chinese characters often had multiple readings (phonetic loans), Rongorongo glyphs like 700 (fish/victim) have multiple meanings depending on context. Recognizing these patterns helps avoid missteps – e.g., we now rarely assume one glyph = one word in all cases, knowing from other scripts that signs can be polyvalent.

To conclude this section, **Rongorongo stands as a rare case of (near-)independent script creation**, and its decipherment process has benefitted from analogies to other writing systems’ early phases. Comparative perspectives underscore that Rongorongo’s features (pictorial signs, rebuses, structural markers) are not alien phenomena but align with the universal trajectory of writing systems. At the same time, nothing in Sumerian cuneiform or Egyptian or any other known script can directly translate a Rongorongo text – it is a distinctly Polynesian creation in content and form. The use of comparisons is thus primarily to inform method and to validate that the types of solutions we propose (like reading a glyph as a pun or identifying a repeated prayer) are reasonable in the broader context of how human writing encodes meaning. This cross-cultural lens ultimately strengthens confidence in our interpretations when they fit Polynesian context and also make sense in light of how writing works.

## Conclusion: Achievements and Ongoing Mysteries

After synthesizing data from all 17 research documents, updated glyph lexicons, and cross-referenced materials, we can clearly state **what has been established** in the Rongorongo decipherment project and **what remains unresolved**:

**Established with High Confidence:** Researchers have **decoded the general meaning** of certain glyphs and sequences, uncovering significant portions of Rongorongo’s content. The Mamari tablet’s lunar calendar stands out as a **confirmed decipherment** – we can assign each glyph in that sequence to a specific night of the Rapa Nui month, proving the script recorded calendrical knowledge. The structure of genealogical lists has been identified on at least two artifacts (Small Santiago G and the Staff), giving credence to glyph 76 as a lineage marker (“offspring of”) and glyph 200 as a term for a person of rank (“chief”). A range of glyphs have been matched to concrete meanings: the **full moon**, **crescents for nights**, **fish = ika (and by metaphor, victim)**, **“phallus” for procreation**, **sand for beach/Anakena**, **cave for tomb**, **bird for bird/manu**, **child for descendant** – all supported by multiple lines of evidence (pictorial resemblance, context of use, and often 19th-century informant hints). We have also deciphered the broad story encoded on Aruku Kurenga (Text B): it is almost certainly the **legend of Easter Island’s discovery and settlement in three voyages**. This is a milestone – effectively reading an entire narrative in Rongorongo by correlating it with oral tradition. Likewise, the repetitive sequences on the Santiago Staff have been interpreted as reflecting a **cosmogonic genealogical chant** or list of names (though debate continues on specifics, the existence of the formula is established). These achievements mean that today we can look at certain parts of a tablet and *know* what they are talking about (e.g. “here are nights of the month”, “here a chief journeys to a beach”, “here is a list of ancestors with their fathers’ names”). The project has also established a robust **glyph lexicon** (as seen in the table above), where dozens of glyphs have entries for proposed meanings, transliterations, and confidence levels. This lexicon, drawing from Barthel, Fischer, Thomas, Guy, Pozdniakov, and new analyses, acts as a foundation for any further decoding. Notably, many of its high-confidence entries (*rā* for moon, *mahare* for full moon old-woman, *ariki* for chief, *iku*/*ika* for fish/victim, *poki* for child, *one* for sand, etc.) have held up under cross-textual scrutiny. In terms of the **nature of the script**, the consensus now firmly leans towards Rongorongo being a **mnemonic, semi-phonetic system**: essentially a logographic script with some phonetic elements, used to record information in a compressed, formulaic way. This view has been established through the convergence of evidence – the script’s statistical patterns, the way glyphs correspond to key words in Rapanui culture, and how scribes omitted many spoken elements (like grammatical particles) and relied on the reader’s knowledge. So, while we can’t “read” it like a normal text, we can **understand it** as a written form of **ritual and knowledge preservation**.

**Remaining Unresolved:** Despite these advances, **no full decipherment** (in the sense of a complete, word-for-word translation of texts) has been achieved. Crucial aspects remain unsolved. We **do not know the exact phonetic values** of most glyphs – if one wanted to read a Rongorongo inscription aloud in Old Rapanui, we could only guess a few words. Many glyphs in the lexicon have tentative readings that need confirmation. For example, the glyph for a star or sun (glyph 8) is still debated – is it the sun (*ra‘ā* in Rapanui) or maybe specifically the planet Venus (which in some traditions is linked to creation)? The confidence is moderate, meaning more proof is needed. Also, beyond the identified glyphs, there are hundreds of less frequent glyphs whose meanings are still mysterious. Some could be variant forms or composites, but others might represent concepts we haven’t identified (specific animals, plants, or completely lost words). **Personal names** in the texts remain largely opaque – we can tell where a personal name likely occurs, but not what the name is. For instance, Aruku Kurenga’s sequences for Hau-Maka and Hotu Matuʻa: we deduced who they are from context, but the glyphs representing “Hau-Maka” or “Hotu” themselves (if present) are not phonetically read. If a new tablet were found with a pure genealogy of Rapa Nui kings, we currently would struggle to match each glyph cluster to a name on the king list without some repetitive clue or external aid. Moreover, some entire **tablets are still not decoded at all**, like the aforementioned Keiti (E) and Tahua (A), and others (texts H, K, Q, etc.). They could contain different genres – for example, a prayer or incantation might have a very different structure. Without a Rosetta Stone or more extensive corpus, deciphering those will be tough. It’s unresolved whether *every* tablet can be fully understood with our current methods, or if some content will remain obscure. Another unresolved question is **how the Rongorongo script handles syntax**: we see the building blocks (nouns, a relational verb, maybe some markers), but not how they indicated tense, or subject vs object if at all. Did word order alone do that? Possibly. Did they even attempt to encode such grammar, or did they leave it entirely to the reciter’s knowledge? This is not yet clear and probably varies by text type. The **phonetics vs semantics balance** is also not fully settled; perhaps further analysis will reveal a subset of glyphs that consistently map to syllables, which could open up reading of names. No one has demonstrated a working phonetic reading scheme that yields known Rapanui phrases – that remains a holy grail.

In terms of *dissent* in the field, Fischer’s claimed decipherment from the 1990s is largely considered unproven, showing that proposed solutions can’t be accepted until they explain **all** evidence coherently. The criticisms of Fischer’s interpretation (inconsistent application of patterns, forced linguistic connections, and mythological inaccuracies) highlight that unresolved issues are often due to *insufficient data* or *overinterpretation of the existing data*. A fully resolved decipherment likely awaits either new evidence (e.g. discovery of a bilingual inscription or a much larger text corpus – which is unlikely) or the creative application of technology (perhaps AI trained on patterns of known languages might find something we’ve missed). The **INSCRIBE project** led by Silvia Ferrara, for example, is currently re-examining the script with advanced tools and a fresh perspective on its development as a near-writing system. They have reaffirmed the script’s pre-contact origin and are probing whether Rongorongo might have started more pictographic and became more standardized over time. Such diachronic studies may explain irregularities: maybe older texts (like Aruku Kurenga, if it’s early) use more pictorial clues, whereas later ones (like the Staff, if it’s later) use more shorthand and abstract forms, making them ironically harder to read now. This internal timeline is unresolved – we don’t know if all tablets were produced in a short period or over a couple of centuries with evolution.

Another unresolved matter is **why Rongorongo died out** and whether any knowledge of it survived beyond what we have. From a decipherment standpoint, if any clues were left by the last scribes, they might be buried in mission records or ethnographic notes not yet analyzed thoroughly. Perhaps some chants recorded in the 20th century have verses that parallel a Rongorongo text but haven’t been recognized. Researchers continue to comb through Polynesian comparative data (songs, symbols, etc.) to find anything that might resonate with the Rongorongo corpus.

Finally, a philosophical unresolved point: Will we ever be able to *read* Rongorongo as fluently as, say, Egyptian hieroglyphs? Or will it always be a partial understanding – identifying topics and keywords rather than exact sentences? Given the limited corpus and the possible proto-writing nature, many scholars caution that a full decipherment in the traditional sense may never be achieved. Instead, the goal is to **continue incrementally**: expanding the lexicon of known glyphs, decoding additional sequences by connecting them with Rapa Nui cultural knowledge, and maybe one day reaching a critical mass where enough of the text is understood that the rest becomes clear by context.

In conclusion, the Rongorongo decipherment project has transformed a mystery once thought impenetrable into a slowly emerging narrative. We have **identified numerous glyphs and their meanings**, uncovered the likely subjects of several tablets (lunar calendar, creation chant, king list, migration story), and developed a multi-method toolkit that leverages everything from Polynesian myths to computer algorithms. What’s been achieved is a testament to interdisciplinary sleuthing – linguistics, anthropology, cryptanalysis, and folklore studies working in concert. What remains is essentially *filling in the gaps*: refining readings, resolving debates like those over glyph 76’s nuance or the Staff’s storyline, and tackling the texts that are still dark. As things stand in 2025, we can **read Rongorongo “in broad strokes”** – for example, recognizing a tablet as a genealogy of chiefs or a chant about the moon or an origin myth – but not in full detail line by line. Each new discovery tightens the net of understanding, making it harder for any given interpretation to be wrong because it must align with a growing number of known points (glyph values, patterns, contexts). The project is ongoing, and optimism is warranted: the convergence of evidence from many angles is painting an ever-clearer picture of the script’s “syntax” and meaning. The **mystery of Rongorongo endures**, but considerably diminished – no longer an undecipherable enigma, it is now a puzzle with many pieces fitted neatly into place and a remaining few pieces tantalizingly close to finding their homes. With continued comprehensive analysis and maybe a bit of luck, we move closer to hearing the voices of ancient Rapa Nui speaking through these glyphs, fulfilling the meaning of *rongorongo* – “to recite, to declaim, to announce” – once more.
