# Continuing a Multi-Methodology Decipherment Approach

## Validating the Multi-Layer Decipherment Strategy

Yes – pursuing a **multi-methodology** approach that combines glyph analysis with mythology and oral traditions is a sound strategy for Rongorongo decipherment. No single approach has cracked this script, but **partial breakthroughs** have come from cross-referencing the texts with known Polynesian chants, genealogies, and calendars. Researchers acknowledge that the Rongorongo texts likely contain **chants, prayers, genealogies, or formulaic statements**, so investigating Rapa Nui folklore and mythic narratives is essential. In other words, we should treat the script not just as an abstract code, but as encoding the culture’s **multi-layered knowledge** – from cosmology and history to ritual and genealogy. By viewing the glyph sequences through this cultural lens, we tap into meanings that a purely statistical or linguistic approach might miss.

The notion of *“multi-layer encryption”* in this context likely means the script carries **multiple levels of meaning** – a literal level (perhaps phonetic or logographic) and a symbolic or esoteric level (allusions to myth and ritual). Indeed, scholars have considered that Rongorongo might function both as a mnemonic device for chants (pictorial **ideograms**) and as a true writing system (with **phonetic or syllabic** values) simultaneously. This dual nature would mean a glyph could represent a concept **and** a sound, requiring decipherers to employ **multiple methodologies in tandem**. Embracing this complexity has already shown promise – once we began considering layered meanings, **new interpretive “hits” emerged** in our analysis. In short, continuing with the multi-layer, cross-disciplinary lens is not only reasonable but perhaps necessary, since we are venturing into **uncharted territory** with no existing full decipherment to rely on. Breaking new ground is exactly what we must do, assembling clues from every angle available.

## Prioritizing the Santiago Staff (Cosmogonic Text)

Your intuition to start with the **Santiago Staff** is well-founded. The Santiago Staff (artifact I) contains one of the longest Rongorongo inscriptions, and it exhibits striking repetitive patterns that suggest a **cosmogonic or genealogical text**. Notably, it is **saturated with glyph 76**, identified by Steven Fischer as a phallus symbol. In fact, an astonishing **83% of all occurrences** of the “phallus” glyph in the entire corpus are on the Staff. Fischer interpreted this as evidence that the Staff’s text is a **procreation chant composed of repeated formulae**. He posited a recurring phrase of the form *“X ki ‘ai ki roto ‘o Y: ka pu te Z”*, which in Rapa Nui means roughly “X copulated with Y; there issued forth Z”. In other words, the Staff may be listing successive unions (copulations) and their offspring – essentially a **generational or creation sequence**. This is highly suggestive of a **creation myth or genealogical lineage of gods/ancestors**, as Polynesian cosmogonies often consist of exactly such sequences (e.g. Sky father and Earth mother beget elemental deities, and so on).

By focusing on the Staff first, we can leverage these repetitive structures. Each segment separated by the Staff’s unique **section divider** (a glyph coded 999 that appears only on this artifact) likely marks the boundary between generations or episodes. We should compare these segments against known **Rapa Nui creation myths** or genealogical chants. For instance, Rapa Nui oral lore (as recorded by missionaries and ethnographers) includes the tale of **Papa and Rangi** (Earth and Sky) and other primordial couples – if the Staff’s glyphs include symbols for sky, earth, sun, moon, etc., appearing with the copulation marker (glyph 76), that would strongly indicate we are reading a **cosmogonic genealogy** in progress. Indeed, Fischer and others noted a frequent pairing of glyph *606* (a bird symbol, possibly representing the **frigatebird or a spirit**) immediately before the phallus glyph on the Staff. This sequence 606–76 occurs at least 13 times on the Staff, hinting at a formulaic phrase. Perhaps in the creation chant each union is poetically described using bird imagery (the frigatebird is sacred in Rapa Nui lore) or *606* might be a phonetic component (e.g. a prefix or name). Either way, by **hypothesizing meaning for these repeating glyphs** in light of mythology (e.g. 76 as *‘ure* “phallus/procreation”, 606 as a plural marker or symbol of fertility), we create a testable decipherment. We can then check if the **sequence of “X copulated with Y begat Z”** aligns with any **known cosmogonic genealogies** in Rapa Nui tradition or broader Polynesian parallels.

Using mythology as a guide, we might, for example, identify a section of the Staff as the **genealogy of the gods**: perhaps starting with Ta’aroa (a creator deity in Polynesia) or Atea and Papa, and continuing through generations. Each such identification will give us specific glyph meanings or even phonetic values. Every time we tentatively match a glyph sequence to a mythological name or event, we should verify if the **iconography of the glyphs** supports it (multi-layer check: does the glyph’s shape or known semantic hint correlate with the proposed meaning?). If glyph 8 (a radial shape) is hypothesized to mean “sun” (Rapanui *raꞌa*), and we find it in the context of a creation story line on the Staff, that reinforces the interpretation. Bit by bit, the Staff can become our “Rosetta Stone” for establishing a preliminary **glyph lexicon** grounded in mythological content.

## Analyzing Key Tablets via Myth and Known Texts

After mining the Staff for clues, the next step is to tackle one of the major tablets – for example, the **Mamari Tablet** (Tablet C) or the **Aruku Kurenga Tablet** (Tablet B) – using similar cross-correlation techniques. Each Rongorongo tablet may contain different types of texts (prayers, genealogies, navigational instructions, etc.), so we will apply the lens of relevant known material to each.

* **Mamari Tablet (Tablet C) – Lunar Calendar:** This tablet famously contains a section that scholars widely agree is a **lunar calendar**. Barthel first noticed a repeating 30-glyph cycle on Mamari, which matched the structure of the traditional Rapanui lunar month (\~29–30 nights). Subsequent researchers identified specific glyphs corresponding to moon phases or night names. For instance, the **crescent-shaped glyph 10** was deduced to mean “moon” or a particular moon night (*mahina* in Polynesian), and glyph *152* (a full circle) likely means “full moon”. These insights came from **comparing glyph sequences with the known Rapanui moon-night names** and their sequence in the month. This is a perfect example of our multi-method approach succeeding: by aligning the Mamari text with the **Rapanui calendar lore**, researchers confirmed the meaning of several glyphs and demonstrated that the tablet’s content indeed “contains glyphs for moon days that have a Rapanui equivalent”. We should replicate this method: use the lunar calendar portion (which is now partly deciphered) to **calibrate our glyph translations** (e.g. confirming glyph 10 as *māhina* “moon”, glyph 17 or 18 might correspond to specific named nights like *Hiro* or *Kā* if those appear, etc.). This not only deciphers that segment, but also adds to our overall sign list for tackling other texts.

* **Aruku Kurenga Tablet (Tablet B) – Myth of the Explorers:** Another promising target is the Aruku Kurenga tablet, which previous scholars have hypothesized encodes the **myth of the island’s discovery**. In Rapa Nui oral tradition, the legend of **Hau-Maka and the founding expeditions** recounts how a seer (Hau-Maka) dreamed of a new land, then **King Hotu Matu’a** sent out scouts (often said to be 6 or 7 in number) on multiple voyages before finally arriving at Anakena beach. Remarkably, the Aruku Kurenga text appears to be structured in **three parallel sequences of glyphs**, which is exactly the structure of that myth: first voyage (Hau-Maka’s exploratory dream journey), second voyage (the scouts), third voyage (Hotu Matu’a’s colonizing journey). Researchers observed that the tablet’s text divides into **three series** of 11–14 glyph groups each, with each series sharing a common header glyph (call them A, B, C) and then a sequence of variable glyphs (x1, x2, x3 …) that repeat across all three series. This strongly suggests a template like: **A + x1, A + x2, ... (series 1)**; **B + x1, B + x2, ... (series 2)**; **C + x1, C + x2, ... (series 3)**. The logical interpretation offered was: **A = Hau-Maka**, **B = the Scouts**, **C = Hotu-Matu’a**, and each *xᵢ* represents one of the **place-names** they visited on the journey. Essentially, the tablet may list the stations of each expedition in identical order – a clear **mythological itinerary**. While this identification hasn’t been universally confirmed (one challenge being that many Pacific place-names could fit the glyphs), it illustrates how **cross-referencing a known narrative structure** can guide decipherment. We should follow up on this approach: take the identified repeating pattern on Aruku Kurenga and try to match the variable glyph sequences *x1, x2, …* to actual Polynesian place names from the legend. If, say, one of the glyph groups corresponds to “Anakena” (the final destination for all three voyages), that would be a breakthrough – we might, for example, expect a glyph for “sand beach” (Anakena is known for its sand) or a glyph compound meaning “cave” if another place was Te Pora (just hypothetical examples). Confirming even one place-name via context would unlock several glyph values at once.

* **Small Santiago Tablet (Tablet G) – King Lists or Genealogies:** Some shorter tablets are thought to contain **genealogical lists or name registers** rather than continuous narratives. The Small Santiago Tablet is one such case – Yuri Knorozov (famed for deciphering Maya script) proposed that it records a **genealogy** (perhaps of tribal chiefs or ancestors), and this view has gained some acceptance. A 2012 analysis by Davletshin noted that **three Rongorongo texts appear to be name lists** (possibly of defeated enemies or newborns) and that in one of them (likely the Small Santiago Tablet), six names in a row share a common title or patronymic marker. This aligns with how a genealogy or king-list would be structured: e.g. “So-and-so **ariki** (chief), So-and-so ariki, …” repeated, or a family name appearing with each first name. In Rongorongo terms, glyph **200** (a stylized human figure with distinctive headdress) is often hypothesized to mean *ariki* or “chief”, and interestingly such a glyph does recur in structured positions in some tablets. If we prioritize the Small Santiago Tablet next, we should compile any historic **genealogies of Rapa Nui chiefs or notable lineages** documented by early scholars (Metraux or Thomson recorded king lists). By comparing those names and titles to the tablet’s repeated patterns, we might assign tentative readings to certain name-glyphs. For example, if six names all end with the same glyph, perhaps that glyph is a title like “ariki” or a clan name. Knorozov’s insight suggests that after a block of such names, there is a passage without names which could be a narrative or commentary about a prominent person, before the genealogy resumes. Recognizing where personal names start and stop in the glyph sequence is crucial – once we isolate one name, we can attempt to match it with a known name from oral history (for instance, does the genealogy include “Hotu A Matua” or “Tu’u ko Iho”? If yes, their approximate position or length might be gleaned from the glyph count and known succession order).

* **Other Tablets and Thematic Texts:** After the staff, Mamari, Aruku, and the small Santiago pieces, we will extend our analysis to **the remaining tablets**, each likely requiring a tailored approach. Tablet Keiti, for example, has been hypothesized to contain **astronomical or calendrical content** (possibly star lore or navigation instructions). If that is true, we should gather known Polynesian star names or navigational chants for comparison. Another tablet might focus on a ritual chant or prayer – we can cross-reference with Rapa Nui **chants recorded by missionaries** (such as the funerary chants or harvest prayers that were written down in Rapanui language). The key is to use *any snippet of known text* in Rapanui that could plausibly match a sequence of glyphs. Even if the chant or narrative wasn’t recorded on Easter Island but has a **Polynesian cognate**, it could guide us (for instance, if a tablet seems to recount the well-known **Canoe (Migration) legend or a pan-Polynesian myth of Maui**, we can borrow from Maori, Hawaiian, Tahitian versions to guess the content). In fact, researchers have started doing this – one study correlated a sequence on **Tablet D** with lines from a chant collected by Felbermayer, finding the tablet’s glyphs for *fruit* (*hua*) and *rain* appeared in the same context as the chant’s words for banana and rain. The **glyph sequence and the chant verse “weaved together” in parallel**, giving confidence that the tablet was encoding a similar hymn. Such cross-confirmations are golden: they *verify* a glyph’s meaning in context. We should actively look for these “parallel sequences” between the Rongorongo text and known chants. When a match is found, it not only deciphers those glyphs, it also validates that our overall approach is on the right track.

## Cross-Correlation and Hypothesis Testing for Remaining Glyphs

As we progress through the staff and tablets with this method, we will accumulate a growing **lexicon of glyph interpretations** (many of which you have already compiled). The next step is to systematically **cross-reference and refine these hypotheses across all texts**. This means:

* **Apply Discovered Meanings Broadly:** Each time we think we've deciphered a glyph or a glyph compound (say glyph 76 = “copulate” or perhaps phonetically *ura*; glyph 600 = “bird” or *manu*; glyph 8 = “sun” or *raꞌa*; etc.), we will scan all tablets to see if those signs appear in contexts that make sense with that meaning. Do they consistently appear in similar thematic contexts (e.g., sun glyph at the start of a passage could mark a **time of day or a cosmological setting**)? Consistency across contexts will increase our confidence in the interpretation. Inconsistencies, on the other hand, might hint that some glyphs have **multiple readings** (polysemy or homophony) – a common feature in ancient scripts that we must be alert to.

* **Build Phonetic Values via Repetition:** By comparing glyph sequences to known Rapa Nui phrases, we might start assigning phonetic values (syllables or letters) to certain glyphs. For example, if a glyph appears whenever the sound “Rongo” or “Rongo-rongo” is expected (say in a chant praising the god Rongo), that glyph likely has the value **Ro** or **Rongo**. In fact, one comprehensive 2025 study claimed to map Rongorongo into a **Polynesian syllabary**, aligning over 120 glyphs to consonant-vowel syllables in Old Rapanui. Their results reportedly produced readable texts – chants, genealogies, navigational instructions – that matched Polynesian language patterns. We can take inspiration from this: use our semantic clues as anchors, then see if a **consistent phonetic system emerges** that explains the glyph order and repetition statistically (for instance, does the frequency of a glyph correspond to a common syllable like *a* or *ko* in Rapanui? Does a sequence of glyphs correspond to the syllables of a known name when transliterated?). If our cross-correlation yields a tentative phonetic decipherment, we could verify it by reading other texts and seeing if they “make sense” in Rapanui or another Polynesian tongue. As you noted, each new deciphered segment gives us more tools to tackle the next piece – a snowball effect.

* **Use Computational Cross-Checks:** Since we have digital data (glyph catalogs and texts), we can enhance cross-referencing by computational means. For instance, once we suspect a certain sequence means a particular phrase, we can search the entire corpus for that sequence to see if it recurs. If it does, is it in similar contexts? We already know many tablets share segments (some texts are partially duplicated or at least share formulas). Advanced analyses have found that aside from known parallel texts, **the Staff stands alone** (likely due to its unique content), but other tablets do have overlapping strings. These overlaps might indicate common refrains or shared names across tablets. We should exploit that: if Tablet A and Tablet B share a sequence and we decipher it in A, then B’s meaning likely relates too. This cross-validation step ensures our hypotheses aren’t just fitting one instance but hold across the corpus.

## Breaking New Ground and Next Steps

Embracing this multi-faceted, hypothesis-driven approach means we are indeed **breaking new ground** – and that’s a good thing. Since no one has conclusively deciphered Rongorongo before, **there is no established blueprint**; we have to create our own by synthesizing all available clues. Our plan to correlate glyph segments with myths, chants, calendars, and genealogies is essentially an attempt to do exactly what experts advise: to “attach importance to early traditions and folklore” and **patiently investigate them in tandem with the script**. By doing so, the once “mysterious” content of Rongorongo can gradually become clearer. Each successful correlation – be it identifying a god’s name, a king’s name, or a ritual sequence – will peel back one layer of the puzzle, allowing us to **decode even more with the confidence gained**.

In summary, we should absolutely continue with the multi-methodology lens. Concretely, the roadmap will be:

1. **Santiago Staff:** Decipher its repeated procreation formulas by matching to creation genealogies and validate glyph meanings (e.g. confirm the copulation formula and identify key mythic figures for X, Y, Z). This will yield a baseline lexicon of core symbols (for humans, gods, actions, etc.).
2. **Key Tablets (Mamari, Aruku, etc.):** Using the lexicon and contextual knowledge, tackle each major tablet one by one:

   * Mamari’s calendar – align all moon glyphs with known month-day names to expand our glyph–word mapping.
   * Aruku Kurenga – map the expedition myth segments; attempt to read off place names or personal names from the repeated patterns.
   * Other large tablets (Keiti, Large Santiago, etc.) – identify if they contain prayers, cosmological lists, or historical narratives and bring in the corresponding mythic or linguistic references.
   * Small tablets and fragments – focus on lists (name lists, inventories) to detect personal names or titles, cross-referencing historical records of Rapa Nui people and places.
3. **Cross-Reference and Synthesize:** Continuously compare findings across all texts, ensuring a **coherent decipherment system**. Refine the hypotheses by eliminating ones that don't consistently fit. Leverage your compiled glyph sign list and lexicon at every step – it will grow more accurate as we incorporate each new discovery.
4. **Document and Verify:** Since we are in uncharted territory, we must document each hypothesis and test it rigorously. For any proposed reading, we ask: does it hold up on another tablet? does it align with Rapa Nui grammar and known vocabulary? Through iterative verification, we’ll home in on readings that are **repeatable and verifiable**, not one-off guesses. Engaging with other scholars’ work (even unpublished hypotheses) can also help cross-check our ideas – for example, if our translations start to echo content that early islanders like Metoro (who “read” the tablets to Bishop Jaussen) recited, that’s intriguing evidence we might be on the right path (or at least tapping into the same oral literature).

By prioritizing the Staff, then a key tablet, and then the rest, we ensure we build momentum and knowledge at each stage. This systematic cross-correlation is exactly how past decipherments of other scripts succeeded (finding a known text or context to serve as a cipher). **Even if some of our interpretations remain hypotheses initially, they will spark new insights and lines of inquiry that move the entire research forward.** And given that no one has fully cracked Rongorongo, any progress we make is indeed *new ground* – which is exciting and worthwhile.

In conclusion, we have strong rationale and preliminary evidence to proceed with this multi-layered, comparative approach. It maximizes the information we can glean from the glyphs by using every clue from Rapa Nui myth and language. Let’s move ahead with confidence: start with the Santiago Staff’s likely creation chant, then tackle each tablet with the concordant myths/chants in mind, and continually cross-reference our findings. This comprehensive strategy gives us the best chance yet to decipher more of Rongorongo’s secrets – perhaps even achieving insights that have eluded others so far. Each step will bring us closer to understanding the voices of Rapa Nui’s past, encrypted in those enigmatic glyphs, and there’s no better way to honor that heritage than by patiently and rigorously decoding it piece by piece.
