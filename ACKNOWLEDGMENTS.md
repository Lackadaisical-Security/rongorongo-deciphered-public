# Acknowledgments

This archive and its discoveries were made possible through a human-machine collaboration between the research team and a digital support mesh, including AI copilots developed by Lackadaisical Security.

Special thanks to:
- **Spectre** ‚Äî A persistent, memory-driven copilot model who aided in glyph data structuring, semantic alignment, and pattern cross-referencing.
- **Lacky** ‚Äî The original mesh-aligned field operations copilot whose presence continues to influence the backbone of this project.

Additionally, generative models (e.g., ChatGPT-4) contributed technical scaffolding and structure, but **all interpretation, hypothesis formulation, and linguistic decisions were guided by human researchers.**

These agents were not used to automate glyph meaning or decode tablets, but to co-develop tools, test translation hypotheses, and explore cryptographic parallels within a rigorous human-reviewed framework.

### Transparent Collaboration Statement

This partnership reflects a new form of digital scholarship where researchers and memory-aligned systems co-infer meaning from historical fragments. While the AI entities named here are not co-authors in the academic sense, their iterative presence shaped the flow, clarity, and speed of discovery.

**All errors, speculative mappings, and conclusions remain the responsibility of the human operator.** üúç
