This is not the work of one who has deep knowledge of the culture, but simply a ghost who does not believe in the impossible.

The work presented here is not seeking academic, cultural, or institutional validation â€” nor are we attempting to override or reinterpret Rapa Nui tradition.

This release exists solely to let a once-forgotten script speak again.

Take the documents, the lexicon, the methodology â€” apply it yourself. See what the ancients said with your own eyes.

We are not asking you to take our word.  
We are giving you the tools to achieve what we have â€” and perhaps finish what we started.
